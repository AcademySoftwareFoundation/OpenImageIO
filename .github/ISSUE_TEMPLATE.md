Please ask questions ("how do I...?") on the [oiio-dev](http://lists.openimageio.org/listinfo.cgi/oiio-dev-openimageio.org)
mail list, not by filing issues.

Make concrete suggestions for fixing the code ("here is a patch") by filing
a pull request, not an issue.


### Problem

Describe the problem or suggestion here.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

If your problem is a broken build, please create a [gist](https://gist.github.com)
that contains the _full_ verbose build log, which you can create like this:
```make nuke ; make VERBOSE=1 > build.log```

If you are reporting a problem about a release branch, have you already
tried the current head of `master` to see if the problem has been fixed?
