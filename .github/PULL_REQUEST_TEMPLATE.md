## Checklist:

<!-- Put an 'x' in the boxes as you complete the checklist items -->

- [ ] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] I have updated the documentation, if applicable.
- [ ] I have ensured that the change is tested somewhere in the testsuite
  (adding new test cases if necessary).
- [ ] If I added or modified a C++ API call, I have also amended the
  corresponding Python bindings (and if altering ImageBufAlgo functions, also
  exposed the new functionality as oiiotool options).
- [ ] My code follows the prevailing code style of this project. If I haven't
  already run clang-format before submitting, I definitely will look at the CI
  test that runs clang-format and fix anything that it highlights as being
  nonconforming.
