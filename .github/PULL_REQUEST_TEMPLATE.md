## Checklist:

<!-- Put an 'x' in the boxes as you complete the checklist items -->

- [ ] I have read the [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] If this is more extensive than a small change to existing code, I
  have previously submitted a Contributor License Agreement
  ([individual](../src/doc/CLA-INDIVIDUAL), and if there is any way my
  employers might think my programming belongs to them, then also
  [corporate](../src/doc/CLA-CORPORATE)).
- [ ] I have updated the documentation, if applicable.
- [ ] I have ensured that the change is tested somewhere in the testsuite
  (adding new test cases if necessary).
- [ ] My code follows the prevailing code style of this project.
