**PLEASE DO NOT ASK USAGE QUESTIONS USING GITHUB "ISSUES"**

If you are pretty sure that you have identified a **BUG** in OpenImageIO,
please file a [bug report issue](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

But if you are just asking a question:
* How do I...?
* I need help with...
* Am I doing something wrong?
* I can't build OpenImageIO

For anything of this nature, the best way to get help using OpenImageIO is
to ask a question on the [oiio-dev developer mail list](https://lists.aswf.io/g/oiio-dev).

The [documentation](https://docs.openimageio.org)
is pretty comprehensive, so please check there first; you may find the answer
more quickly than you can get your question answered on the mail list.
