**PLEASE DO NOT ASK USAGE QUESTIONS USING GITHUB "ISSUES"**

If you are pretty sure that you have identified a **BUG** in OpenImageIO,
please file a [bug report issue](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

But if you are just asking a question:
* How do I...?
* I need help with...
* Am I doing something wrong?
* I can't build OpenImageIO

For anything of this nature, the best way to get help using OpenImageIO is
to ask a question on the [oiio-dev developer mail list](http://lists.openimageio.org/listinfo.cgi/oiio-dev-openimageio.org).

The [documentation](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/src/doc/openimageio.pdf)
is pretty comprehensive, so please check there first; you may find the answer
more quickly than you can get your question answered on the mail list.
