Build a variant for Rez/general use
-----------------------------------

Skip this section if you are instead building for SpComp2.

Note: For testing or to make your own local rez package, you can customize
either the rez package name, or the rez install location name, with make
flags `OIIO_REZ_NAME=blah REZ_PACKAGE_ROOT=/path/to/my/rez/pkgs` appended
to the `make` commands of any of the variants listed below. For example,

    make OIIO_SPIREZ=1 OIIO_REZ_NAME=oiio_test REZ_PACKAGE_ROOT=/path/to/my/rez/pkgs


Variants:

    # Python 2.7, Boost 1.55, C++11/gcc4.8 compat
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPIREZ=1

    # Python 2.7, Boost 1.55 sp namespaced, C++11/gcc4.8 compat
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPIREZ=1 BOOSTSPSUFFIX=sp

    # Python 3.7, Boost 1.66, C++11/gcc6.3 compat
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPIREZ=1 BOOSTVERS=1.66 PYTHON_VERSION=3.7 SPI_COMPILER_PLATFORM=gcc-6.3

    # Python 3.6, Boost 1.55, C++11/gcc4.8 compat (for Jon Ware)
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPIREZ=1 PYTHON_VERSION=3.6

You can do any of these on your local machine.


Rez/general release (do for each variant)
-----------------------------------------

This must be done from compile40 or compile42 (for correct write
permissions on certain shared directories), even if you did the build
itself locally.

First:

    ss spi/home
    cd /the/oiio/src/area
    cd dist/rhel7

For any of the variants that you built above:

    rez release --skip-repo-errors

That command will release the dist to the studio.


Appwrapper binary releases
--------------------------

This step is for the ONE general/rez variant that we believe is the
canonical source of command line oiiotool and maketx. After building and
releasing as above,

    cp OpenImageIO_*.xml /shots/spi/home/lib/app_cfg/OpenImageIO

That will make appcfg aware of the release.

To also make this release the new facility default:

    db-any spi/home/OpenImageIO.bin highest /shots/spi/home/lib/app_cfg/OpenImageIO/OpenImageIO_A.B.C.D.xml

where A.B.C.D is the version.


SpComp2 build and release
-------------------------

If you are trying to do an SpComp2 release, forget all the steps above, you
will need some different flags.

First, to make a TEST build and release to your local spcomp2 mock-up
in /net/soft_scratch/users/$USER, use this alternate target:

    make OIIO_SPCOMP2=1 ... spcomp2_install_local

When you are ready for the real thing, you will want to build each of the
following variants:

    # Python 2.7, Boost 1.55, C++11/gcc4.8 compat
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPCOMP2=1 spcomp2_install

    # Python 2.7, Boost 1.55 sp namespaced, C++11/gcc4.8 compat
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPCOMP2=1 BOOSTSPSUFFIX=sp spcomp2_install

    # Python 3.7, Boost 1.66, C++11/gcc6.3 compat
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPCOMP2=1 BOOSTVERS=1.66 PYTHON_VERSION=3.7 SPCOMP2_COMPILER=gcc63m64 spcomp2_install

    # Python 3.6, Boost 1.55, C++11/gcc4.8 compat (for Jon Ware)
    make nuke
    make OIIO_SPCOMP2=1 PYTHON_VERSION=3.6 spcomp2_install

Nobody should do this but lg, except in extraordinary circumstances.
