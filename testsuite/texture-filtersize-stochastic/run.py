# This test just views the "miplevels" texture straight on, but it uses
# -widthramp to smoothly blend between mipmap levels from left to right
# (wanting the 256^2 level at the left and the 64^2 level at the right).
# Using MIPmode StochasticAniso and pseudo-random variate, this tests that
# we are blending between the levels correctly.
