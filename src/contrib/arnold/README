to test, first launch iv in foreground mode:

	iv -F

then, from a different shell, run kick.  but first, you need to setup
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:

	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ARNOLD_HOME}/bin:${OIIO_DIST}/lib

on osx, make sure that arnold's library path comes first, so that kick does not find the newer,
incompatible library in OIIO_DIST. Alternately, you can simply remove the unversioned
symlink:

	rm ${OIIO_DIST}/lib/libOpenImageIO.dylib

then ensure arnold finds the "arnold_driver" plugin:

	export ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH=${OIIO_DIST}/lib

then render the test file:

	kick -dp -dw test.ass
