/// A spin_mutex is semantically equivalent to a regular mutex, except

///    large (44 bytes for pthread).
///  - A spin_mutex is extremely fast to lock and unlock, whereas a regular
///    mutex is surprisingly expensive just to acquire a lock.

/// lock for a very short period of time, you may save runtime by using
/// a spin_mutex, even though it's non-blocking.
