/// function_view<R(T...)> is a lightweight non-owning generic callable
/// object view, similar to a std::function<R(T...)>, but with much less
/// overhead.
///
/// A function_view invocation should have the same cost as a function
/// pointer (which it basically is underneath). Similar in spirit to a
/// string_view or span, the function-like object that the function_view
/// refers to MUST have a lifetime that outlasts any use of the
/// function_view.
///
/// In contrast, a full std::function<> is an owning container for a
/// callable object. It's more robust, especially with respect to object
/// lifetimes, but the call overhead is quite high. So use a function_view
/// when you can.
///
/// This implementation comes from LLVM:
/// https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/master/include/llvm/ADT/STLExtras.h
