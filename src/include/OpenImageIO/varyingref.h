/// VaryingRef is a templated class (on class T) that holds either a
/// pointer to a single T value, or an "array" of T values, each
/// separated by a certain number of bytes.  For those versed in the
/// lingo of SIMD shading, this encapsulates 'uniform' and 'varying'
/// references.
///
/// Suppose you have a computation 'kernel' that is performing an
/// operation while looping over several computation 'points.'  Each of
/// the several operands of the kernel may either be a 'uniform' value
/// (identical for each point), or 'varying' (having a potentially
/// different value for each point).
///
/// Here is a concrete example.  Suppose you have the following function:
///
///     void add (int n, float *a, float *b, float *result) {
///         for (int i = 0;  i < n;  ++i)
///             result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
///     }
///
/// But if the caller of this function has only a single b value (let's
/// say, you always want to add 3 to every a[i]), you would be forced
/// to replicate an entire array full of 3's in order to call the function.
///
/// Instead, we may wish to generalize the function so that each operand
/// may refer to EITHER a single value or an array of values, without
/// making the code more complicated.  We can do this with VaryingRef:
///
///     void add (int n, VaryingRef<float> a, VaryingRef<float> b,
///                      float *result) {
///         for (int i = 0;  i < n;  ++i)
///             result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
///     }
///
/// VaryingRef overloads operator [] to properly decode whether it is
/// uniform (point to the one value) or varying (index the right array
/// element).  It also overloads the increment operator ++ and the pointer
/// indirection operator '*', so you could also write the function
/// equivalently as:
///
///     void add (int n, VaryingRef<float> a, VaryingRef<float> b,
///                      float *result) {
///         for (int i = 0;  i < n;  ++i, ++a, ++b)   // note increments
///             result[i] = (*a) + (*b);
///     }
///
/// An example of calling this function would be:
///
///     float a[n];
///     float b;     // just 1 value
///     float result[n];
///     add (n, VaryingRef<float>(a,sizeof(a[0])),
///          VaryingRef<float>(b), result);
///
/// In this example, we're passing a truly varying 'a' (signified by
/// giving a step size from element to element), but a uniform 'b' (signified
/// by no step size, or a step size of zero).
///
/// There are Varying() and Uniform() templated functions that provide
/// a helpful shorthand:
///
///     add (n, Varying(a), Uniform(b), result);
///
/// Now let's take it a step further and fully optimize the 'add' function
/// for when both operands are uniform:
///
///     void add (int n, VaryingRef<float> a, VaryingRef<float> b,
///                      VaryingRef<float> result) {
///         if (a.is_uniform() && b.is_uniform()) {
///             float r = (*a) + (*b);
///             for (int i = 0;  i < n;  ++i)
///                 result[i] = r;
///         } else {
///             // One or both are varying
///             for (int i = 0;  i < n;  ++i, ++a, ++b)
///                 result[i] = (*a) + (*b);
///         }
///     }
///
/// This is the basis for handling uniform and varying values efficiently
/// inside a SIMD shading system.
