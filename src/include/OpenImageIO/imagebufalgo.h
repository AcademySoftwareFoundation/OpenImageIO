///
/// All IBA functions take a ROI.  Only the pixels (and channels) in dst
/// that are specified by the ROI will be altered; the default ROI is to
/// alter all the pixels in dst.  Exceptions will be noted, including 
/// functions that do not honor their channel range.
///
/// In general, IBA functions that are passed an initialized 'dst' or
/// 'result' image do not reallocate it or alter its existing pixels
/// that lie outside the ROI (exceptions will be noted). If passed an
/// uninitialized result image, it will be reallocatd to be the size of
/// the ROI (and with float pixels).  If the result image passed is
/// uninitialized and also the ROI is undefined, the ROI will be the
/// union of the pixel data regions of any input images.  (A small
/// number of IBA functions, such as fill(), have only a result image
/// and no input image; in such cases, it's an error to have both an
/// uninitiailized result image and an undefined ROI.)
///
/// IBA functions that have an 'nthreads' parameter use it to specify
/// how many threads (potentially) may be used, but it's not a
/// guarantee.  If nthreads == 0, it will use the global OIIO attribute
/// "nthreads".  If nthreads == 1, it guarantees that it will not launch
/// any new threads.

/// appropriate error message set in dst).
