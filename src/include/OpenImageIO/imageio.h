/// `OIIO::attribute()` sets an global attribute (i.e., a property or
/// option) of OpenImageIO. The `name` designates the name of the attribute,
/// `type` describes the type of data, and `val` is a pointer to memory
/// containing the new value for the attribute.
///
/// If the name is known, valid attribute that matches the type specified,
/// the attribute will be set to the new value and `attribute()` will return
/// `true`.  If `name` is not recognized, or if the types do not match
/// (e.g., `type` is `TypeFloat` but the named attribute is a string), the
/// attribute will not be modified, and `attribute()` will return `false`.
///
/// The following are the recognized attributes:
///
/// - `string options`
///
///    This catch-all is simply a comma-separated list of `name=value`
///    settings of named options, which will be parsed and individually set.
///    For example,
///
///        OIIO::attribute ("options", "threads=4,log_times=1");
///
///    Note that if an option takes a string value that must itself contain
///    a comma, it is permissible to enclose the value in either 'single'
///    or "double" quotes.
///
/// - `int threads`
///
///    How many threads to use for operations that can be sped up by being
///    multithreaded. (Examples: simultaneous format conversions of multiple
///    scanlines read together, or many ImageBufAlgo operations.) The
///    default is 0, meaning to use the full available hardware concurrency
///    detected.
///
///    Situations where the main application logic is essentially single
///    threaded (i.e., one top-level call into OIIO at a time) should leave
///    this at the default value, or some reasonable number of cores, thus
///    allowing lots of threads to fill the cores when OIIO has big tasks to
///    complete. But situations where you have many threads at the
///    application level, each of which is expected to be making separate
///    OIIO calls simultaneously, should set this to 1, thus having each
///    calling thread do its own work inside of OIIO rather than spawning
///    new threads with a high overall "fan out.""
///
/// - `int exr_threads`
///
///    Sets the internal OpenEXR thread pool size. The default is to use as
///    many threads as the amount of hardware concurrency detected. Note
///    that this is separate from the OIIO `"threads"` attribute.
///
/// - `string plugin_searchpath`
///
///    Colon-separated list of directories to search for dynamically-loaded
///    format plugins.
///
/// - `int read_chunk`
///
///    When performing a `read_image()`, this is the number of scanlines it
///    will attempt to read at a time (some formats are more efficient when
///    reading and decoding multiple scanlines).  The default is 256. The
///    special value of 0 indicates that it should try to read the whole
///    image if possible.
///
/// - `float[] missingcolor`, `string missingcolor`
///
///    This attribute may either be an array of float values, or a string
///    containing a comma-separated list of the values. Setting this option
///    globally is equivalent to always passing an `ImageInput`
///    open-with-configuration hint `"oiio:missingcolor"` with the value.
///
///    When set, it gives some `ImageInput` readers the option of ignoring
///    any *missing* tiles or scanlines in the file, and instead of treating
///    the read failure of an individual tile as a full error, will
///    interpret is as an intentionally missing tile and proceed by simply
///    filling in the missing pixels with the color specified. If the first
///    element is negative, it will use the absolute value, but draw
///    alternating diagonal stripes of the color. For example,
///
///        float missing[4] = { -1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // striped red
///        OIIO::attribute ("missingcolor", TypeDesc("float[4]"), &missing);
///
///    Note that only some file formats support files with missing tiles or
///    scanlines, and this is only taken as a hint. Please see
///    chap-bundledplugins_ for details on which formats accept a
///    `"missingcolor"` configuration hint.
///
/// - `int debug`
///
///    When nonzero, various debug messages may be printed. The default is 0
///    for release builds, 1 for DEBUG builds (values > 1 are for OIIO
///    developers to print even more debugging information), This attribute
///    but also may be overridden by the OPENIMAGEIO_DEBUG environment
///    variable.
///
/// - `int tiff:half`
///
///    When nonzero, allows TIFF to write `half` pixel data. N.B. Most apps
///    may not read these correctly, but OIIO will. That's why the default
///    is not to support it.
///
/// - `int log_times`
///
///    When the `"log_times"` attribute is nonzero, `ImageBufAlgo` functions
///    are instrumented to record the number of times they were called and
///    the total amount of time spent executing them. It can be overridden
///    by environment variable `OPENIMAGEIO_LOG_TIMES`. If the value of
///    `log_times` is 2 or more when the application terminates, the timing
///    report will be printed to `stdout` upon exit.
///
///    When enabled, there is a slight runtime performance cost due to
///    checking the time at the start and end of each of those function
///    calls, and the locking and recording of the data structure that holds
///    the log information. When the `log_times` attribute is disabled,
///    there is no additional performance cost.
///
///    The report of totals can be retrieved as the value of the
///    `"timing_report"` attribute, using `OIIO:get_attribute()` call.
///
