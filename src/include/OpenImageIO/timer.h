/// Simple timer class.
///
/// This class allows you to time things, for runtime statistics and the
/// like.  The simplest usage pattern is illustrated by the following
/// example:
///
/// \code
///    Timer mytimer;                // automatically starts upon construction
///    ...do stuff
///    float t = mytimer();          // seconds elapsed since start
///
///    Timer another (false);        // false means don't start ticking yet
///    another.start ();             // start ticking now
///    another.stop ();              // stop ticking
///    another.start ();             // start again where we left off
///    another.stop ();
///    another.reset ();             // reset to zero time again
/// \endcode
///
/// These are not very high-resolution timers.  A Timer begin/end pair
/// takes somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.1 - 0.3 us (microseconds),
/// and can vary by OS.  This means that (a) it's not useful for timing
/// individual events near or below that resolution (things that would
/// take only tens or hundreds of processor cycles, for example), and
/// (b) calling it millions of times could make your program appreciably
/// more expensive due to the timers themselves.
