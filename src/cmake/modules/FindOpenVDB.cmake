# - Find OPENVDB library
# Find the native OPENVDB includes and library
# This module defines
#  OPENVDB_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find openvdb.h, Set when
#                            OPENVDB_INCLUDE_DIR is found.
#  OPENVDB_LIBRARIES, libraries to link against to use OPENVDB.
#  OpenVDB_ROOT, The base directory to search for OPENVDB.
#                        This can also be an environment variable.
#  OPENVDB_FOUND, If false, do not try to use OPENVDB.
#
# also defined, but not for general use are
#  OPENVDB_LIBRARY, where to find the OPENVDB library.
