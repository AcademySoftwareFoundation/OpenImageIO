# Module to find OpenEXR.
#
# This module will first look into the directories defined by the variables:
#   - OPENEXR_HOME, OPENEXR_VERSION, OPENEXR_LIB_AREA
#
# It also supports non-standard names for the library components.
#
# To use a custom OpenEXR
#   - Set the variable OPENEXR_CUSTOM to True
#   - Set the variable OPENEXR_CUSTOM_LIBRARY to the name of the library to
#     use, e.g. "SpiIlmImf"
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# OPENEXR_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find ImfRgbaFile.h, OpenEXRConfig, etc.
# OPENEXR_LIBRARIES   - list of libraries to link against when using OpenEXR.
#                       This list does NOT include the IlmBase libraries.
#                       These are defined by the FindIlmBase module.
# OPENEXR_FOUND       - True if OpenEXR was found.
