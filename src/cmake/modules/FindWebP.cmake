# This module will first look into the directories defined by the variables:
#   - Webp_ROOT, WEBP_INCLUDE_PATH, WEBP_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# WebP_FOUND            True if Webp was found.
# WEBP_INCLUDES         Where to find Webp headers
# WEBP_LIBRARIES        List of libraries to link against when using Webp
#
# This doesn't work, because the webp headers don't seem to include any
# definitions giving the version:
# WEBP_VERSION          Version of Webp (e.g., 3.6.2)
