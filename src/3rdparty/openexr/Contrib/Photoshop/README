                    Building the OpenEXR Photoshop plug-in

The Macintosh build requires Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8.3 (or higher).
The Windows build requires Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (or higher).

1) install the Photoshop SDK

These projects expect that you have checked the "Photoshop" 
module out to the same root directory that contains the other
OpenEXR modules, and that you have added a directory called 
"sdk" to the Photoshop module that contains the Adobe Photoshop
SDK.  Your source tree should look like this:

|- MacCodeWarrior
|- OpenEXR
|- Photoshop
      |- doc
      |- mac
      |- rsrc
      |- sdk
      |   |- PhotoshopAPI
      |   |- PhotoshopUtils
      |   |- resources
      |- src
      |- win32
|- zlib

Note that this distribution does not include the Photoshop SDK because of
licensing issues.  You must be a registered Adobe developer to obtain this
SDK.  Visit www.adobe.com to learn more.

The "Photoshop/sdk/resources" folder can be found here:

{Photoshop SDK}/samplecode/resources

This contains the tools necessary to create the PiPL resources on the Windows platform. 
If you're unfamiliar with PiPLs, there is some excellent documentation available
in the Photoshop SDK.

Note that if you're only interested in building the Windows version of this plug-in,
you don't need to check out the "MacCodeWarrior" module from the OpenEXR repository.
If you plan to make changes for submission to CVS, though, please make sure they
work correctly on both platforms.

2) build zlib

Both the Mac and Windows builds require a static library, "zlib.lib", to be built.
The Macintosh project will look for the library in "MacCodeWarrior/zlib-1.1.3",
while the Windows project will look for the library in "zlib".  

Zlib source is not included with this distribution because of licensing issues.
The source is available for download at www.gzip.org/zlib/ and is very easy to
build on any platform.

3) build the plug-ins

Macintosh: 

- open the project file "Photoshop/mac/EXRFormat.mcp" in CodeWarrior.
- build the target "Plugin".

This will build both Carbon and Classic versions of the plug-in in the
package "Photoshop/mac/EXRFormat".  It will also turn this folder into
a package, but you may have to log out and log back in to see this change 
in the Finder.


Windows:

- open the project file "Photoshop/win32/EXRFormat.dsw" in VC++.
- you will be asked to locate the file "SimpleFormat.dsp".  Choose 
  "Photoshop/win32/EXRFormat.dsp".  If you know how to stop VC++ from
  asking for this file, please let me know.\
- build the target "Win32 - Release".

This will create the plug-in "Photoshop/win32/Release/EXRFormat.8bi"

4) install the plug-in:

Copy the built plug-in to the "Plug-Ins" folder located in the directory
where Photoshop lives.

5) Enjoy!
