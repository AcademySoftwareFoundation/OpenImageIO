Version 1.0.0:
	* Initial release of this code.

Version 1.0.1:
	* Fixed misinterpretation of values read from "deepopacity" dtex files.
	The data stored is actually transmission, or 1.0-opacity, which means
	that "deepopacity" dtex values actually monotonically decrease from 1
	to 0.  We have updated the comments and documentation to reflect this
	and have fixed the PxOneChanDeepOpacity file to convert the data 
	as it is read out of the file.
