ABOUT THE OPENEXR_VIEWERS LIBRARIES
----------------------------

exrdisplay:

exrdisplay is a simple still image viewer that optionally applies color
transforms to OpenEXR images, using ctl as explained in this document: 

    doc/OpenEXRViewers.pdf

exrdisplay requires FLTK 1.1 or greater and OpenGL.

playexr:

playexr is a program that plays back OpenEXR image sequences, optionally
with CTL support, applying rendering and display transforms in line with
the current discussions at the AMPAS Image Interchange Framework committee
(September 2006).

The playexr directory contains the source code for the playback program,
and two sample CTL transforms (one rendering and one display transform).

playexr requires OpenGL, GLUT and the Cg hardware shading language.


If you have installed the OpenEXR_CTL package, exrdisplay and playexr
will automatically be built with CTL support.  If you don't have
OpenEXR_CTL, the programs will still work, but CTL support will be
disabled.

If you have questions about using the OpenEXR_Viewers package, you 
may want to join our developer mailing list.  See http://www.openexr.com 
for details.


LICENSE
-------

The OpenEXR_Viewers source code distribution is free software.  See the file
named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.


BUILDING OPENEXR_VIEWERS
----------------

Building OpenEXR_Viewers requires the OpenEXR library.  CTL support in
OpenEXR_Viewers requires the OpenEXR_CTL library.

If you want to build the 'exrdisplay' image viewer, you'll need FLTK
1.1 or higher.

If you want to buyild the playexr image viewer, you'll need GLUT
and the Cg hardware shading language.

Your OS distribution may already include these libraries, or supply
packages for them.  That is the preferred way to obtain them for use
with OpenEXR.  If not, you can obtain the source code for FLTK from:

   http://www.fltk.org

and you can download the NVIDIA Cg SDK from
http://developer.nvidia.com.

If you're building OpenEXR_VIEWERS on a Windows platform, see README.win32
for instructions.  The remainder of this file applies only to GNU/Linux or
other UNIX-like systems.

After installing the required libraries, to build OpenEXR_Viewers on
GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do this:

./configure
make
make install

unless you obtained OpenEXR_Viewers directly from CVS, in which case you
should first read README.CVS.

If you have the Nvidia Cg SDK and you want to build support for
fragment shaders into exrdisplay, specify the path to the SDK using
the "--with-cg-prefix" flag.  There are some additional compile-time
configuration options available; type `./configure --help` for more
information.

See README.OSX for details on building OpenEXR in MacOS X.

Do `make check` to run the OpenEXR confidence tests.  They should all
pass; if you find a test that does not pass on your system, please let
us know.

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting OpenEXR to a particular
platform.

All include files needed to use the OpenEXR libraries are installed in the 
OpenEXR subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/OpenEXR.
