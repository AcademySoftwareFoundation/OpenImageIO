OpenEXR_Viewers on MacOS X
------------------

Building OpenEXR_Viewers on MacOS X is just like building it on GNU/Linux.
Follow the instructions in the README file under BUILDLING OPENEXR_VIEWERS,
but see below re: shared libraries.

On OS X 10.4, you can build universal binaries by passing
'--enable-osx-universal-binaries --disable-dependency-tracking' to the
configure script.  The default is *not* to build universal binaries.


Known bugs
----------

None.
