\chapter{Comparing Images With {\kw idiff}}
\label{chap:idiff}
\indexapi{idiff}

\section{Overview}
The {\cf idiff} program compares two images, printing a report about how
different they are and optionally producing a third image that records
the pixel-by-pixel differences between them.  There are a variety of
options and ways to compare (absolute pixel difference, various
thresholds for warnings and errors, and also an optional perceptual
difference metric).

Because {\cf idiff} is built on top on \product, it can compare two
images of any formats readable by \ImageInput plugins on hand.  They may
have any (or different) file formats, data formats, etc.

\section{Using {\cf idiff}}

The {\cf idiff} utility is invoked as follows:

\bigskip

\hspace{0.25in} {\cf idiff} [\emph{options}] \emph{image1} \emph{image2}

\medskip

Where \emph{input1} and \emph{input2} are the names of two image files
that should be compared.  They may be of any format recognized by
\product (i.e., for which image-reading plugins are available).

If the two input images are not the same resolutions, or do not have the
same number of channels, the comparison will return FAILURE immediately
and will not attempt to compare the pixels of the two images.  If 
they are the same dimensions, the pixels of the two images will be
compared, and a report will be printed including the mean and maximum
error, how many pixels were above the warning and failure thresholds,
and whether the result is {\cf PASS}, {\cf WARNING}, or {\cf FAILURE}.
For example:

\begin{code}
    $ idiff a.jpg b.jpg

    Comparing "a.jpg" and "b.jpg"
      Mean error = 0.00450079
      RMS error = 0.00764215
      Peak SNR = 42.3357
      Max error  = 0.254902 @ (700, 222, B)
      574062 pixels (82.1%) over 1e-06
      574062 pixels (82.1%) over 1e-06
    FAILURE
\end{code}

% $

The ``mean error'' is the average difference (per channel, per pixel).
The ``max error'' is the largest difference in any pixel channel,
and will point out on which pixel and channel it was found.
It will also give a count of how many pixels were above the warning
and failure thresholds.

The metadata of the two images (e.g., the comments) are not currently
compared; only differences in pixel values are taken into consideration.

\subsection*{Raising the thresholds}

By default, if any pixels differ between the images, the comparison
will fail.  You can allow \emph{some} differences to still pass by
raising the failure thresholds.  The following example will allow
images to pass the comparison test, as long as no more than 10\%
of the pixels differ by 0.004 (just above a 1/255 threshold):

\begin{code}
    idiff -fail 0.004 -failpercent 10 a.jpg b.jpg
\end{code}

But what happens if a just a few pixels are very different?  Maybe you
want that to fail, also.  The following adjustment will fail if at least
10\% of pixels differ by 0.004, or if \emph{any} pixel differs by
more than 0.25:

\begin{code}
    idiff -fail 0.004 -failpercent 10 -hardfail 0.25 a.jpg b.jpg
\end{code}

If none of the failure criteria are met, and yet some pixels are 
still different, it will still give a WARNING.  But you can also
raise the warning threshold in a similar way:

\begin{code}
    idiff -fail 0.004 -failpercent 10 -hardfail 0.25 \
             -warn 0.004 -warnpercent 3 a.jpg b.jpg
\end{code}

\noindent The above example will PASS as long as fewer than 3\%
of pixels differ by more than 0.004.  If it does, it will be a
WARNING as long as no more than 10\% of pixels differ by 0.004
and no pixel differs by more than 0.25, otherwise it is a FAILURE.

%\subsection*{Perceptual differences}


\subsection*{Output a difference image}

Ordinary text output will tell you how many pixels failed or were
warnings, and which pixel had the biggest difference.  But sometimes
you need to see visually where the images differ.  You can get
{\cf idiff} to save an image of the differences between the two input
images:

\begin{code}
    idiff -o diff.tif -abs a.jpg b.jpg
\end{code}

The {\cf -abs} flag saves the absolute value of the differences
(i.e., all positive values or zero).  If you omit the {\cf -abs},
pixels in which {\cf a.jpg} have smaller values than {\cf b.jpg}
will be negative in the difference image (be careful in this case
of using a file format that doesn't support negative values).

You can also scale the difference image with the {\cf -scale},
making them easier to see.  And the {\cf -od} flag can be used
to output a difference image only if the comparison fails, but 
not if the images pass within the designated threshold (thus
saving you the trouble and space of saving a black image).


\section{{\cf idiff} Reference}

The various command-line options are discussed below:

\subsection*{General options}

\apiitem{--help}
Prints usage information to the terminal.
\apiend

\apiitem{-v}
Verbose output --- more detail about what it finds when comparing
images, even when the comparison does not fail.
\apiend

\apiitem{-a}
Compare all subimages.  Without this flag, only the first subimage
of each file will be compared.
\apiend


\subsection*{Thresholds and comparison options}

\apiitem{-fail {\rm \emph{A}} \\
-failpercent {\rm \emph{B}} \\
-hardfail {\rm \emph{C}}}

Sets the threshold for {\cf FAILURE}: if more than \emph{B}\% of pixels
(on a 0-100 floating point scale) are greater than \emph{A} different,
or if \emph{any} pixels are more than \emph{C} different.  The defaults
are to fail if more than 0\% (any) pixels differ by more than 0.00001
(1e-6), and \emph{C} is infinite.
\apiend

\apiitem{-warn {\rm \emph{A}} \\
-warnpercent {\rm \emph{B}} \\
-hardwarn {\rm \emph{C}}}

Sets the threshold for {\cf WARNING}: if more than \emph{B}\% of pixels
(on a 0-100 floating point scale) are greater than \emph{A} different,
or if \emph{any} pixels are more than \emph{C} different.  The defaults
are to warn if more than 0\% (any) pixels differ by more than 0.00001
(1e-6), and \emph{C} is infinite.
\apiend

\apiitem{-p}
Does an additional test on the images to attempt to see if they are
\emph{perceptually} different (whether you are likely to discern
a difference visually), using Hector Yee's metric.  If this option
is enabled, the statistics will additionally show a report on how
many pixels failed the perceptual test, and the test overall will
fail if more than the ``fail percentage'' failed the perceptual test.
\apiend

\subsection*{Difference image output}

\apiitem{-o {\rm \emph{outputfile}}}
Outputs a \emph{difference image} to the designated file.
This difference image pixels consist are each of the value of the
corresponding pixel from \emph{image1} minus the value of the
pixel \emph{image2}.  

The file extension of the output file is used to determine the file
format to write (e.g., \qkw{out.tif} will write a TIFF file,
\qkw{out.jpg} will write a JPEG, etc.).  The data format of the output
file will be format of whichever of the two input images has higher
precision (or the maximum precision that the designated output format is
capable of, if that is less than either of the input imges).

Note that pixels whose value is lower in \emph{image1} than in
\emph{image2}, this will result in negative pixels (which may be clamped
to zero if the image format does not support negative values)), unless
the {\cf -abs} option is also used.  
\apiend

\apiitem{-abs}
Will cause the output image to consist of the \emph{absolute value}
of the difference between the two input images (so all values in the
difference image $\ge 0$).
\apiend

\apiitem{-scale {\rm \emph{factor}}}
Scales the values in the difference image by the given (floating point)
factor.  The main use for this is to make small actual differences more
visible in the resulting difference image by giving a large scale factor.
\apiend

\apiitem{-od}
Causes a difference image to be produce \emph{only} if the image
comparison fails.  That is, even if the {\cf -o} option is used,
images that are within the comparison threshold will not write out
a useless black (or nearly black) difference image.
\apiend

\subsection*{Process return codes}

The {\cf idiff} program will return a code that can be used by scripts
to indicate the results:

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{p{0.3in} p{5in}}
0 & OK: the images match within the warning and error
thresholds. \\
1 & Warning: the errors differ a little, but within error thresholds. \\ 
2 & Failure: the errors differ a lot, outside error thresholds. \\
3 & The images weren't the same size and couldn't be compared. \\
4 & File error: could not find or open input files, etc.
\end{tabular}

\begin{code}
\end{code}
