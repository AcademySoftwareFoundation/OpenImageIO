OpenImageIO consists of:

  * Simple APIs for reading and writing image files in a format-agnostic
    manner, and plugins to read many common image formats including
    TIFF, JPEG, OpenEXR, PNG, HDR, ICO, and BMP.
  * Image utilities, including an image viewer, printing image information, 
    format conversion, image comparison, and others.
  * A library for image texture lookups, and a managed image cache
    that allows an application to access hundreds of GB of image data
    using little runtime RAM.
