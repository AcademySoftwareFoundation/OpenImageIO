Overview
========


The :program:`oiiotool` program will read images (from any file format for
which an ImageInput plugin can be found), perform various operations on
them, and write images (in any format for which an ImageOutput plugin can be
found).

The :program:`oiiotool` utility is invoked as follows:

    `oiiotool` *args*

:program:`oiiotool` maintains an *image stack*, with the top image in the
stack also called the *current image*.  The stack begins containing no
images.

:program:`oiiotool` arguments consist of image names, actions, and flags.

* Image names: When an image name is encountered, that image is pushed on the
  stack and becomes the new *current image*.

* Actions: Alter the current image (replacing it with the alteration), or in
  some cases will pull more than one image off the stack (such as the current
  image and the next item on the stack) and then push a new result image onto
  the stack.

* Flags: A small number of arguments are non-positional -- the order doesn't
  matter and their effect applies to the entire :program:`oiiotool` execution.

Argument order matters!
-----------------------

:program:`oiiotool` processes actions and inputs *in order*. Thus, the order
of operations on the command line is extremely important. For example,

.. code-block::

    oiiotool in.tif -resize 640x480 -o out.tif

has the effect of reading :file:`in.tif` (thus making it the *current
image*), resizing it (taking the original off the stack, and placing the
resized result back on the stack), and then writing the new current image to
the file :file:`out.tif`.  Contrast that with the following subtly-incorrect
command::

    oiiotool in.tif -o out.tif -resize 640x480

has the effect of reading :file:`in.tif` (thus making it the *current
image*), saving the current image to the file :file:`out.tif` (note that it
will be an exact copy of :file:`in.tif`), resizing the current image, and
then... exiting. Thus, the resized image is never saved, and :file:`out.tif`
will be an unaltered copy of :file:`in.tif`.

The exceptions to this are non-positional flags, which affect the entire
:program:`oiiotool` command regardless of where they appear on the command
line.

Optional modifiers
-----------------------

Some arguments stand completely on their own (like `--flip`), others take one
or more subsequent command line arguments (like `--resize` or `-o`)::

    oiiotool foo.jpg --flip --resize 640x480 -o out.tif


A few arguments take optional modifiers for options that are so rarely-used
or confusing that they should not be required arguments. In these cases,
they are appended to the command name, after a colon (`:`), and with a
*name=value* format.  Multiple optional modifiers can be chained together,
with colon separators. As an example:

.. code-block:: none

        oiiotool in.tif --text:x=400:y=600:color=1,0,0 "Hello" -o out.tif
                        \____/\____/\____/\__________/ \____/
                          |     |     |        |         |
           command -------+     |     |        |         +----- required argument
                                |     |        |
    optional modifiers ---------+-----+--------+
    (separated by ':')

The *value* itself may be a single- or double-quoted string, and this is how
you would make a value that itself contains a `:` character (which would
otherwise denote the beginning of the next modifier).

Expression evaluation and substitution
----------------------------------------------

:program:`oiiotool` can perform *expression evaluation and substitution* on
command-line arguments. As command-line arguments are needed, they are
scanned for containing braces `{ }`. If found, the braces and any text they
enclose will be evaluated as an expression and replaced by its result. The
contents of an expression may be any of:

* *number*

  A numerical value (e.g., 1 or 3.14159).

* *imagename.metadata*

  The named metadata of an image.
  
  If there is no metadata whose name matches, the expression will not have any
  substitution made and an error will be issued.
  
  The *imagename* may be one of: `TOP` (the top or current image), `IMG[i]`
  describing the i-th image on the stack (thus `TOP` is a synonym for
  `IMG[0]`, the next image on the stack is `IMG[1]`, etc.), or `IMG[name]`
  to denote an image named by filename or by label name. Remember that the
  positions on the stack (including `TOP`) refer to *at that moment*, with
  successive commands changing the contents of the top image.
  
  The *metadata* may be any of:
  
  * the name of any standard metadata of the specified image (e.g.,
    `ImageDescription`, or `width`)
  * `filename` : the name of the file (e.g., `foo.tif`)
  * `file_extension` : the extension of the file (e.g., `tif`)
  * `full_geom` : the "full" or "display" size)
  * `geom` : the pixel data size in the form `640x480+0+0`)
  * `nativeformat` : the pixel data type from the file.
  * `MINCOLOR` : the minimum value of each channel over the entire image
    (channels are comma-separated)
  * `MAXCOLOR` : the maximum value of each channel over the entire image
    (channels are comma-separated)
  * `AVGCOLOR` : the average pixel value of the image (channels are
    comma-separated)
  * `META` : a multi-line string containing the full metadata of the image,
    similar to what would be printed with `oiiotool -info -v`.
  * `METABRIEF` : a string containing the brief one-line description,
    similar to what would be printed that with `oiiotool -info`.
  * `METANATIVE` : like `META`, but for the "native" original information from
    when the file was read from disk.
  * `METANATIVEBRIEF` : like `METABRIEF`, but for the "native" original
    information from when the file was read from disk.
  * `STATS` : a multi-line string containing the image statistics that would
    be printed with `oiiotool -stats`.

* *imagename.'metadata'*

  If the metadata name is not a "C identifier" (initial letter followed by
  any number of letter, number, or underscore), it is permissible to use
  single or double quotes to enclose the metadata name. For example, suppose
  you want to retrieve metadata named "foo/bar", you could say

  .. code-block::

      {TOP.'foo/bar'}

  Without the quotes, it might try to retrieve `TOP.foo` (which doesn't
  exist) and divide it by `bar`.

* *imagename[metadata]*

  Another way to retrieve metadata, but with this notation, the result will
  be the empty string if the metadata does not exist (that is not an error).

  .. code-block::

      {TOP[foo]}
      {TOP['bar:baz']}

* Arithmetic

  Sub-expressions may be joined by `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, and `%` for
  arithmetic operations. (Note that like in Python 3, `/` is floating point
  division, while `//` signifies integer division.) Parentheses are
  supported, and standard operator precedence applies.

* Numeric and logical comparisons

  Comparisons between numbers may be made with `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and
  `!=`. In each case, the result will be 0 if the comparison is false, 1 if
  the comparison is true.

  The `<=>` operator is a three-way comparison, returning -1, 0, or 1,
  depending on whether the first operand is less than, equal to, or greater
  than the second operand.

  The `&&` operator has a result of 1 if both the left and right expressions
  are nonzero, otherwise 0. And `||` has a result of 1 if either the left or
  right are nonzero, 0 if both evaluate to 0.

* User variables

  User variables are set by the `--set` command. A reference to a user
  variable in an expression will be replaced by the value of the variable.

* Special variables

  * `FRAME_NUMBER` : the number of the frame in this iteration of
    wildcard expansion.
  * `FRAME_NUMBER_PAD` : like `FRAME_NUMBER`, but 0-padded based
    on the value set on the command line by `--framepadding`.
  * `NIMAGES` : the number of images currently on the stack. (Added in OIIO
     2.4.11.)

* Functions

  * `getattribute(name)` : returns the global attribute that would be
    retrieved by `OIIO::getattribute(name, ...)`. The `name` may be enclosed
    in single or double quotes or be a single unquoted sequence of characters.
    (Added in OIIO 2.3.)


To illustrate how this works, consider the following command, which trims
a four-pixel border from all sides and outputs a new image prefixed with
"cropped_", without needing to know the resolution or filename of the
original image::

    oiiotool input.exr -cut "{TOP.width-2*4}x{TOP.height-2*4}+{TOP.x+4}+{TOP.y+4}" \
        -o cropped_{TOP.filename}

If you should come across filenames that contain curly braces (these are very
rare, but have been known to happen), you temporarily disable expression
evaluation with the `--evaloff` end `--evalon` flags. For example::

    $ oiiotool --info "{weird}.exr"
    > oiiotool ERROR: expression : syntax error at char 1 of `weird'

    $ oiiotool --info --evaloff "{weird}.exr"
    > {weird.exr}          : 2048 x 1536, 3 channel, half openexr


.. _sec-oiiotool-control-flow-explanation:

Control flow
----------------------------------------------

Scriptability is provided by the use of control flow statements.
The usual programming constructs are supported:

* Conditionals : `--if` *condition* `--then` *commands...* `--else` *commands...* `--endif`

* General looping: `--while` *condition* *commands...* `--endwhile`

* Iteration : `--for` *variable* *range* *commands...* `--endfor`

  The range is a sequence of one to three comma-separated numbers: *begin*,
  *end*, and *step*; *begin* and *end* (step is assumed to be 1); or just
  *end* (begin assumed to be 0, step assumed to be 1). As in Python, the range
  has an "exclusive end" -- when the *variable* is equal to *end*, the loop
  will terminate, without actually running the commands for the *end* value
  itself.

Section :ref:`sec-oiiotool-control-flow-commands` contains more detailed
descriptions of these commands and some examples to more clearly illustrate
their behavior.



Frame sequences
-----------------------

It is also possible to have :program:`oiiotool` operate on numbered
sequences of images.  In effect, this will execute the :program:`oiiotool`
command several times, making substitutions to the sequence arguments in
turn.

Image sequences are specified by having filename arguments to oiiotool use
either a numeric range wildcard (designated such as `1-10#` or a
`printf`-like notation `1-10%d`), or spelling out a more complex pattern
with `--frames`.  For example::

    oiiotool big.1-3#.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.1-3#.tif

    oiiotool big.1-3%04d.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.1-3%04d.tif

    oiiotool --frames 1-3 big.#.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.#.tif

    oiiotool --frames 1-3 big.%04d.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.%04d.tif

Any of those will be the equivalent of having issued the following sequence
of commands::

    oiiotool big.0001.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.0001.tif
    oiiotool big.0002.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.0002.tif
    oiiotool big.0003.tif --resize 100x100 -o small.0003.tif

The frame range may be forwards (`1-5`) or backwards (`5-1`), and may give a
step size to skip frames (`1-5x2` means 1, 3, 5) or take the complement of
the step size set (`1-5y2` means 2, 4) and may combine subsequences with a
comma.

If you are using the `#` or `@` wildcards, then the wildcard characters
themselves specify how many digits to pad with leading zeroes, with `#`
indicating 4 digits and `@` indicating one digit (these may be combined:
`#@@` means 6 digits). An optional `--framepadding` can also be used to
override the number of padding digits. For example::

    oiiotool --framepadding 3 --frames 3,4,10-20x2 blah.#.tif

would match `blah.003.tif`, `blah.004.tif`, `blah.010.tif`, `blah.012.tif`,
`blah.014.tif`, `blah.016.tif`, `blah.018.tif`, `blah.020.tif`.

Alternately, you can use the `printf` notation, such as::

    oiiotool --frames 3,4,10-20x2 blah.%03d.tif

When using frame ranges, keep in mind that by default, any error (such as an
input file not being found) on any frame will exit oiiotool right away.
However, the `--skip-bad-frames` command line option causes an error to skip
the rest of the processing for that frame, but try to continue iteration
with the next frame.

Two special command line arguments can be used to disable numeric wildcard
expansion: `--wildcardoff` disables numeric wildcard expansion for
subsequent command line arguments, until `--wildcardon` re-enables it for
subsequent command line arguments. Turning wildcard expansion off for
selected arguments can be helpful if you have arguments that must contain
the wildcard characters themselves. For example::

    oiiotool input.@@@.tif --wildcardoff --sattrib Caption "lg@openimageio.org" \
        --wildcardon -o output.@@@.tif


In this example, the `@` characters in the filenames should be expanded into
numeric file sequence wildcards, but the `@` in the caption (denoting an
email address) should not.

Stereo wildcards
-----------------------

:program:`oiiotool` can also handle image sequences with separate left and
right images per frame using `views`. The `%V` wildcard will match the full
name of all views and `%v` will match the first character of each view. View
names default to "left" and "right", but may be overridden using the
`--views` option. For example::

    oiiotool --frames 1-5 blah_%V.#.tif

would match `blah_left.0001.tif`, `blah_right.0001.tif`,
`blah_left.0002.tif`, `blah_right.0002.tif`, `blah_left.0003.tif`,
`blah_right.0003.tif`, `blah_left.0004.tif`, `blah_right.0004.tif`,
`blah_left.0005.tif`, `blah_right.0005.tif`, and

.. code-block::

    oiiotool --frames 1-5 blah_%v.#.tif

would match `blah_l.0001.tif`, `blah_r.0001.tif`, `blah_l.0002.tif`,
`blah_r.0002.tif`, `blah_l.0003.tif`, `blah_r.0003.tif`, `blah_l.0004.tif`,
`blah_r.0004.tif`, `blah_l.0005.tif`, `blah_r.0005.tif`, but

.. code-block::

    oiiotool --views left --frames 1-5 blah_%v.#.tif

would only match `blah_l.0001.tif`, `blah_l.0002.tif`, `blah_l.0003.tif`,
`blah_l.0004.tif`, `blah_l.0005.tif`.



.. _sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier:

Dealing with multi-subimage/multi-part files
----------------------------------------------

Some file formats allow storing multiple images in one file (notably
OpenEXR, which calls them "multi-part"). There are some special behaviors to
be aware of for multi-subimage files.

Using :program:`oiiotool` for a simple input-to-output copy will preserve
all of the subimages (assuming that the output format can accommodate
multiple subimages)::

    oiiotool multipart.exr -o another.exr

Most :program:`oiiotool` commands by default work on just the *first*
subimage of their input, discarding the others. For example::

    oiiotool multipart.exr --colorconvert lnf aces -o out.exr

In this example, only the first subimage in `multipart.exr` will be color
transformed and output to `out.exr`. Any other subimages in the input will
not be used or copied.

Using the `-a` command tells :program:`oiiotool` to try to preserve all
subimages from the inputs and apply all computations to all subimages::

    oiiotool -a multipart.exr --colorconvert lnf aces -o out.exr

Now all subimages of `multipart.exr` will be transformed and output.

But that might not be enough. Perhaps there are some subimages that need the
color conversion, and others that do not. Many :program:`oiiotool` commands
take an optional modifier `:subimages=...` that can restrict the operation
to certain subimages. The argument is a comma-separated list of any of the
following: (a) an integer index of a subimage to include, or a minus sign
(`-`) followed by an integer index of a subimage to exclude; (b) the name
(as returned by the metadata "oiio:subimagename") of a subimage to include,
or to exclude if preceded by a `-`; (c) the special string "all", meaning all
subimages. Examples::

    # Color convert only subimages 0, 3, and 4, leave the rest as-is
    oiiotool -a multipart.exr --colorconvert:subimages=0,3,4 lnf aces -o out.exr

    # Color convert all subimages EXCEPT the one named "normal"
    oiiotool -a multipart.exr --colorconvert:subimages=-normal lnf aces -o out.exr



:program:`oiiotool` Tutorial / Recipes
======================================

This section will give quick examples of common uses of :program:`oiiotool`
to get you started.  They should be fairly intuitive, but you can read the
subsequent sections of this chapter for all the details on every command.

Printing information about images
---------------------------------

To print the name, format, resolution, and data type of an image (or many
images)::

    oiiotool --info *.tif


To also print the full metadata about each input image, use both
`--info` and `-v`::

    oiiotool --info -v *.tif

or::

    oiiotool --info:verbose=1 *.tif

To print info about all subimages and/or MIP-map levels of each input image,
use the `-a` flag::

    oiiotool --info -v -a mipmap.exr

To print statistics giving the minimum, maximum, average, and standard
deviation of each channel of an image, as well as other information about
the pixels::

    oiiotool --stats img_2012.jpg

The `--info`, `--stats`, `-v`, and `-a` flags may be used in any
combination.


Converting between file formats
-------------------------------

It's a snap to convert among image formats supported by OpenImageIO (i.e.,
for which ImageInput and ImageOutput plugins can be found). The
:program:`oiiotool` utility will simply infer the file format from the file
extension. The following example converts a PNG image to JPEG::

    oiiotool lena.png -o lena.jpg

The first argument (`lena.png`) is a filename, causing :program:`oiiotool` to
read the file and makes it the current image.  The `-o` command
outputs the current image to the filename specified by the next
argument.

Thus, the above command should be read to mean, "Read `lena.png` into the
current image, then output the current image as `lena.jpg` (using whatever
file format is traditionally associated with the `.jpg` extension)."


Comparing two images
--------------------

To print a report of the differences between two images of the same
resolution:

.. code-block:: bash

    oiiotool old.tif new.tif --diff

If you also want to save an image showing just the differences:

.. code-block:: bash

    oiiotool old.tif new.tif --diff --absdiff -o diff.tif


This looks complicated, but it's really simple: read `old.tif`, read
`new.tif` (pushing `old.tif` down on the image stack), report the
differences between them, subtract `new.tif` from `old.tif` and replace them
both with the difference image, replace that with its absolute value, then
save that image to `diff.tif`.

Sometimes you want to compare images but allow a certain number of small
difference, say allowing the comparison to pass as long as no more than
1% of pixels differs by more than 1/255, and as long as no single pixel
differs by more than 2/255. You can do this with thresholds::


    oiiotool old.tif new.tif --fail 0.004 -failpercent 1 --hardfail 0.008 --diff



Changing the data format or bit depth
-------------------------------------

Just use the `-d` option to specify a pixel data format for all subsequent
outputs.  For example, assuming that `in.tif` uses 16-bit unsigned integer
pixels, the following will convert it to an 8-bit unsigned pixels::

    oiiotool in.tif -d uint8 -o out.tif

For formats that support per-channel data formats, you can override the
format for one particular channel using `-d CHNAME=TYPE`. For example,
assuming `rgbaz.exr` is a `float` RGBAZ file, and we wish to convert it to
be `half` for RGBA, and `float` for Z.  That can be accomplished with the
following command::

    oiiotool rgbaz.tif -d half -d Z=float -o rgbaz2.exr

When converting from a high bit depth data type (like float or half) to a very
low bit depth data type (such as uint8), you may notice "banding" artifacts in
smooth gradients. To combat this, you can use the `--dither` option to add
random dither before the low bit depth quantization, which has the effect of
masking the banding::

    oiiotool half.exr -d uint8 --dither -o out8.tif

Note that `--dither` turns dither on for all 8 bit (or fewer) output
files. Alternately, you can enable dither for individual outputs using
a modifier to `-o` (the value of the dither modifier is the random seed
that will be used)::

    oiiotool half.exr -d uint8 -o:dither=1 out8.tif


Changing the compression
------------------------

The following command converts writes a TIFF file, specifically using LZW
compression::

    oiiotool in.tif --compression lzw -o compressed.tif

The following command writes its results as a JPEG file at a compression
quality of 50 (pretty severe compression), illustrating how some compression
methods allow a quality metric to be optionally appended to the name::

    oiiotool big.jpg --compression jpeg:50 -o small.jpg


Converting between scanline and tiled images
--------------------------------------------

Convert a scanline file to a tiled file with 16x16 tiles::

    oiiotool s.tif --tile 16 16 -o t.tif

Convert a tiled file to scanline::

    oiiotool t.tif --scanline -o s.tif




Adding captions or metadata
---------------------------

Add a caption to the metadata::

    oiiotool foo.jpg --caption "Hawaii vacation" -o bar.jpg

Add keywords to the metadata::

    oiiotool foo.jpg --keyword "volcano,lava" -o bar.jpg

Add other arbitrary metadata::

    oiiotool in.exr --attrib "FStop" 22.0 \
            --attrib "IPTC:City" "Berkeley" -o out.exr

    oiiotool in.exr --attrib:type=timecode smpte:TimeCode "11:34:04:00" \
            -o out.exr

    oiiotool in.exr --attrib:type=int[4] FaceBBox "140,300,219,460" \
            -o out.exr



Changing image boundaries and borders
-------------------------------------

Change the origin of the pixel data window::

    oiiotool in.exr --origin +256+80 -o offset.exr

Change the display window::

    oiiotool in.exr --fullsize 1024x768+16+16 -o out.exr

Change the display window to match the data window::

    oiiotool in.exr --fullpixels -o out.exr

Crop (trim) an image to a 128x128 region whose upper left corner is at
location (900,300), leaving the remaining pixels in their original positions
on the image plane (i.e., the resulting image will have origin at 900,300),
and retaining its original display window::

    oiiotool in.exr --crop 128x128+900+300 -o out.exr

Cut (trim and extract) a 128x128 region whose upper left corner is at
location (900,300), moving the result to the origin (0,0) of the image plane
and setting the display window to the new pixel data window::

    oiiotool in.exr --cut 128x128+900+300 -o out.exr

Put a constant-color border around all sides of an image, without needing to
know the resolution of the input image::

    # BW: Border width
    BW=40
    COLOR=.2,.2,.2,1.0
    oiiotool in.tif \
        --pattern constant:color=$COLOR "{TOP.width+2*$BW}x{TOP.height+2*$BW}" "{TOP.nchannels}" --paste "+$BW+$BW" \
        -o out.tif


Scale the values in an image
----------------------------

Reduce the brightness of the R, G, and B channels by 10%,
but leave the A channel at its original value::

    oiiotool original.exr --mulc 0.9,0.9,0.9,1.0 -o out.exr


Remove gamma-correction from an image
-------------------------------------

Convert a gamma-corrected image (with gamma = 2.2) to linear values::

    oiiotool corrected.exr --powc 2.2,2.2,2.2,1.0 -o linear.exr

Resize an image
---------------

Resize to a specific resolution::

    oiiotool original.tif --resize 1024x768 -o specific.tif

Resize both dimensions by a known scale factor::

    oiiotool original.tif --resize 200% -o big.tif
    oiiotool original.tif --resize 25% -o small.tif

Resize each dimension, independently, by known scale factors::

    oiiotool original.tif --resize 300%x200% -o big.tif
    oiiotool original.tif --resize 100%x25% -o small.tif

Resize to a known resolution in one dimension, with the other dimension
automatically computed to preserve aspect ratio (just specify 0 as the
resolution in the dimension to be automatically computed)::

    oiiotool original.tif --resize 200x0 -o out.tif
    oiiotool original.tif --resize 0x1024 -o out.tif

Resize to fit into a given resolution, keeping the original aspect ratio and
padding with black where necessary to fit into the specified resolution::

    oiiotool original.tif --fit 640x480 -o fit.tif



Color convert an image
----------------------

This command linearizes a JPEG assumed to be in sRGB, saving as an HDRI
OpenEXR file::

    oiiotool photo.jpg --colorconvert sRGB linear -o output.exr

And the other direction::

    oiiotool render.exr --colorconvert linear sRGB -o fortheweb.png

This converts between two named color spaces (presumably defined by your
facility's OpenColorIO configuration)::

    oiiotool in.dpx --colorconvert lg10 lnf -o out.exr



Grayscale and RGB
-----------------

Turn a single channel image into a 3-channel gray RGB::

    oiiotool gray.tif --ch 0,0,0 -o rgb.tif

Convert a color image to luminance grayscale::

    oiiotool RGB.tif --chsum:weight=.2126,.7152,.0722 -o luma.tif


Channel reordering and padding
------------------------------

Copy just the color from an RGBA file, truncating the A, yielding RGB only::

    oiiotool rgba.tif --ch R,G,B -o rgb.tif

Zero out the red and green channels::

    oiiotool rgb.tif --ch R=0,G=0,B -o justblue.tif

Swap the red and blue channels from an RGBA image::

    oiiotool rgba.tif --ch R=B,G,B=R,A -o bgra.tif

Extract just the named channels from a many-channel image, as efficiently as
possible (avoiding memory and I/O for the unused channels)::

    oiiotool -i:ch=R,G,B manychannels.exr -o rgb.exr

Add an alpha channel to an RGB image, setting it to 1.0 everywhere, and
naming it "A" so it will be recognized as an alpha channel::

    oiiotool rgb.tif --ch R,G,B,A=1.0 -o rgba.tif


Add an alpha channel to an RGB image, setting it to be the same as the R
channel and naming it "A" so it will be recognized as an alpha channel::

    oiiotool rgb.tif --ch R,G,B,A=R -o rgba.tif

Add a *z* channel to an RGBA image, setting it to 3.0 everywhere, and naming
it "Z" so it will be recognized as a depth channel::

    oiiotool rgba.exr --ch R,G,B,A,Z=3.0 -o rgbaz.exr



Copy metadata from one image to another
---------------------------------------

Suppose you have a (non-OIIO) application that consumes input Exr files and
produces output Exr files, but along the way loses crucial metadata from
the input files that you want carried along. This command will add all the
metadata from the first image to the pixels of the second image::

    oiiotool metaonly.exr pixelsonly.exr --pastemeta -o combined.exr


Fade between two images
-----------------------

Fade 30% of the way from A to B::

    oiiotool A.exr --mulc 0.7 B.exr --mulc 0.3 --add -o fade.exr



Simple compositing
------------------

Simple "over" composite of aligned foreground and background::

    oiiotool fg.exr bg.exr --over -o composite.exr

Composite of small foreground over background, with offset::

    oiiotool fg.exr --origin +512+89 bg.exr --over -o composite.exr



Creating an animated GIF from still images
------------------------------------------

Combine several separate JPEG images into an animated GIF with a frame rate
of 8 frames per second::

    oiiotool foo??.jpg --siappendall --attrib FramesPerSecond 10.0 -o anim.gif



Frame sequences: composite a sequence of images
-----------------------------------------------

Composite foreground images over background images for a series of files
with frame numbers in their names::

    oiiotool fg.1-50%04d.exr bg.1-50%04d.exr --over -o comp.1-50%04d.exr


Or::

    oiiotool --frames 1-50 fg.%04d.exr bg.%04d.exr --over -o comp.%04d.exr



Expression example: annotate the image with its caption
-------------------------------------------------------

This command reads a file, and draws any text in the "ImageDescription"
metadata, 30 pixels from the bottom of the image::

    oiiotool input.exr --text:x=30:y={TOP.height-30} {TOP.ImageDescription} -o out.exr

Note that this works without needing to know the caption ahead of time, and
will always put the text 30 pixels from the bottom of the image without
requiring you to know the resolution.


Contrast enhancement: stretch pixel value range to exactly fit [0-1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This command reads a file, subtracts the minimum pixel value and then
divides by the (new) maximum value, per channel, thus expanding its pixel
values to the full [0-1] range::

    oiiotool input.tif -subc {TOP.MINCOLOR} -divc {TOP.MAXCOLOR} -o out.tif

Note that this is a naive way to improve contrast and because each channel
is handled independently, it may result in color hue shifts.


Split a multi-image file into separate files
--------------------------------------------

Take a multi-image TIFF file, split into its constituent subimages and
output each one to a different file, with names `sub0001.tif`,
`sub0002.tif`, etc.::

    oiiotool multi.tif -sisplit -o:all=1 sub%04d.tif

:program:`oiiotool` commands: general flags
===========================================================

.. option:: --help

    Prints full usage information to the terminal, as well as information
    about image formats supported, known color spaces, filters, OIIO build
    options and library dependencies.

.. option:: --version

    Prints the version designation of the OIIO library.

.. option:: -v

    Verbose status messages --- print out more information about what
    :program:`oiiotool` is doing at every step.

.. option:: -q

    Quet mode --- print out less information about what :program:`oiiotool`
    is doing (only errors).

.. option:: -n

    No saved output --- do not save any image files. This is helpful for
    certain kinds of tests, or in combination with `--runstats` or
    `--debug`, for getting detailed information about what a command
    sequence will do and what it costs, but without producing any saved
    output files.

.. option:: --no-error-exit

    If an error is encountered, try to continue executing any remaining
    commands, rather than exiting immediately. Use with caution!

.. option:: --debug

    Debug mode --- print lots of information about what operations are being
    performed.

.. option:: --runstats

    Print timing and memory statistics about the work done by
    :program:`oiiotool`.

.. option:: -a

    Performs all operations on all subimages and/or MIPmap levels of each
    input image.  Without `-a`, generally each input image will really
    only read the top-level MIPmap of the first subimage of the file.

.. option:: --no-clobber

    Sets "no clobber" mode, in which existing images on disk will never be
    overridden, even if the `-o` command specifies that file.

.. option:: --threads <n>

    Use *n* execution threads if it helps to speed up image operations. The
    default (also if n=0) is to use as many threads as there are cores
    present in the hardware.

.. option:: --cache <size>

    Set the underlying ImageCache size (in MB). See Section
    :ref:`sec-imagecache-api`.

.. option:: --oiioattrib <name> <value>

    Adds or replaces a global OpenImageIO attribute with the given *name* to
    have the specified *value*.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `type=` *typename* : Specify the metadata type.

    If the optional `type=` specifier is used, that provides an explicit
    type for the metadata. If not provided, it will try to infer the type of
    the metadata from the value: if the value contains only numerals (with
    optional leading minus sign), it will be saved as `int` metadata; if it
    also contains a decimal point, it will be saved as `float` metadata;
    otherwise, it will be saved as a `string` metadata.

    Examples::

        oiiotool --oiioattrib debug 1 in.jpg -o out.jpg


.. _sec-oiiotool-control-flow-commands:

:program:`oiiotool` commands for control flow
=============================================

.. option:: --set <name> <value>

    Adds or replaces a "user variable". User variables may be
    referenced by name in expression substitution.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `type=` *typename* : Specify the metadata type.

    If the optional `type=` specifier is used, that provides an explicit type
    for the variable. If not provided, it will try to infer the type from the
    value: if the value contains only numerals (with optional leading minus
    sign), it will be saved as `int`; if it also contains a decimal point, it
    will be saved as a `float`; otherwise, it will be saved as a `string`.

    This command was added in OIIO 2.4.0.

    Examples::

        $ oiiotool --set i 42 --echo "i = {i}"
        i = 42

.. option:: --if <condition> true-cmds... --endif
            --if <condition> true-cmds... --else false-cmds... --endif

    If the *condition* is true, execute *true-cmds*, otherwise execute
    *false-cmds*.

    The *condition* is considered false if it is integer 0 or float 0.0 or the
    empty string ``""``, or any of the strings ``off``, ``false``, or ``no``
    (without regard to capitalization). All other values or strings are
    assumed to be considered "true" for the evaluation of the condition.

    Examples::

        # Read in.exr, and if it only has 3 channels, add an alpha channel
        # that is 1.0 everywhere, but if it already has 4 channels, leave
        # it alone. Then output the result to out.exr.
        $ oiiotool in.exr --if "{TOP.nchannels == 3}" --ch ,,,A=1.0 --endif -o rgba.exr

.. option:: --for <variable> <range> commands... --endfor

    Iterate a *variable* over a *range*, executing the *commands*
    for each iteration. The range may be one, two, or three numbers
    separated by commas, indicating

    - *end* : Iterate from 0 to *end*, incrementing by 1 each time.
    - *begin* ``,`` *end* : Iterate from *begin* to *end*, incrementing
       by 1 each time.
    - *begin* ``,`` *end* ``,`` *step* : Iterate from *begin* to *end*,
      incrementing by *step* each time.

    Note that the *end* value is "exclusive," that is, the loop will
    terminate once the value is equal to end, and the loop body will
    not be executed for the *end* value.

    Examples::

        $ oiiotool --for i 5 --echo "i = {i}" --endfor
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4

        $ oiiotool --for i 5,10 --echo "i = {i}" --endfor
        5
        6
        7
        8
        9

        $ oiiotool --for i 5,10,2 --echo "i = {i}" --endfor
        5
        7
        9

.. option:: --while <condition> commands... --endwhile

    If the *condition* is true, execute *commands*, and keep doing that
    until the *condition* is false.

    The *condition* is considered false if it is integer 0 or float 0.0 or the
    empty string ``""``, or any of the strings ``off``, ``false``, or ``no``
    (without regard to capitalization). All other values or strings are
    assumed to be considered "true" for the evaluation of the condition.

    Examples::

        $ oiiotool -set i 0 --while "{i < 5}" --echo "i = {i}" -set i "{i + 1}" --endwhile
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4
    
.. option:: --frames <seq>
            --framepadding <n>

    Describes the frame range to substitute for the `#` or `%0Nd` numeric
    wildcards.  The sequence is a comma-separated list of subsequences; each
    subsequence is a single frame (e.g., `100`), a range of frames
    (`100-150`), or a frame range with step (`100-150x4` means
    `100,104,108,...`).

    The frame padding is the number of digits (with leading zeroes applied)
    that the frame numbers should have.  It defaults to 4.

    For example,

        oiiotool --framepadding 3 --frames 3,4,10-20x2 blah.#.tif

    would match `blah.003.tif`, `blah.004.tif`, `blah.010.tif`,
    `blah.012.tif`, `blah.014.tif`, `blah.016.tif`, `blah.018.tif`,
    `blah.020.tif`.

.. option:: --views <name1,name2,...>

    Supplies a comma-separated list of view names (substituted for `%V`
    and `%v`). If not supplied, the view list will be `left,right`.

.. option:: --skip-bad-frames

    When iterating over a frame range, if this option is used, any errors
    will cease processing that frame, but continue iterating with the next
    frame (rather than the default behavior of exiting immediately and not
    even attempting the other frames in the range).

.. option:: --parallel-frames

    When iterating over a frame range or views, if this option is used, the
    frames will run *concurrently* and not necessarily in any deterministic
    order.

    Running the range of frames in parallel is helpful in cases where (a)
    there are enough frames in the range to make it be better to parallelize
    over the range rather than within each operation (rule of thumb: you
    should probably have at least as many frames to process as cores
    available); (b) it doesn't matter what order the frames are processed in
    (e.g., no frames have a dependency on the computed results of earlier
    frames); and (c) you have enough memory and I/O bandwidth to handle all
    the parallel jobs (probably equal to the number of cores).

    Without the `--parallel-frames` option, the frame range will be executed
    in increasing numerical order and each frame in the range will run to
    completion before the next one starts. Multithreading will be used for the
    individual operations done to each frame. This mode is less efficient if
    you have more frames than cores available, but it is guaranteed to be safe
    even if there are order or data dependencies between your frames, and it

    This feature was added to OpenImageIO 2.5.1.

.. option:: --wildcardoff, --wildcardon

    These *positional* options turn off (or on) numeric wildcard expansion
    for subsequent command line arguments. This can be useful in selectively
    disabling numeric wildcard expansion for a subset of the command line.

.. option:: --evaloff, --evalon

    These *positional* options turn off (or on) expression evaluation (things
    with `{ }`)  for subsequent command line arguments. This can be useful in
    selectively disabling expression evaluation expansion for a subset of the
    command line, for example if you actually have filenames containing curly
    braces.




:program:`oiiotool` commands: reading and writing images
========================================================

The commands described in this section read images, write images, or control
the way that subsequent images will be written upon output.

.. _sec-oiiotool-i:

Reading images
--------------

.. option:: <filename>
            -i <filename>

    If a command-line option is the name of an image file, that file will be
    read and will become the new *current image*, with the previous current
    image pushed onto the image stack.

    The `-i` command may be used, which allows additional options that control
    the reading of just that one file.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:now=` *int*
        If 1, read the image now, before proceeding to the next command.
      `:autocc=` *int*
        Enable or disable `--autocc` for this input image (the default is to use
        the global setting).
      `:unpremult=` *int*
        If autocc is used for this image, should any color transformation be
        done on unassociated colors (unpremultiplied by alpha). The default is 0.
      `:info=` *int*
        Print info about this file (even if the global `--info` was not used) if
        nonzero. If the value is 2, print full verbose info (like `--info -v`).
      `:infoformat=` *name*
        When printing info, the format may be one of: `text` (default) for
        readable text, or `xml` for an XML description of the image metadata.
      `:type=` *name*
        Upon reading, convert the pixel data to the named type. This can
        override the default behavior of internally storing whatever type is the
        most precise one found in the file.
      `:ch=` *name...*
        Causes the input to read only the specified channels. This is equivalent
        to following the input with a `--ch` command, except that by integrating
        into the `-i`, it potentially can avoid the I/O of the unneeded
        channels.

.. option:: --iconfig <name> <value>

    Sets configuration hint metadata that will apply to the next input file
    read. Input configuration hint settings are cleared after an image is
    read, and must be specified separately for every `-i` or image filename to
    read.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `type=` *typename* : Specify the metadata type.

    If the optional `type=` specifier is used, that provides an explicit
    type for the metadata. If not provided, it will try to infer the type of
    the metadata from the value: if the value contains only numerals (with
    optional leading minus sign), it will be saved as `int` metadata; if it
    also contains a decimal point, it will be saved as `float` metadata;
    otherwise, it will be saved as a `string` metadata.

    Examples::

        oiiotool --iconfig "oiio:UnassociatedAlpha" 1 in.png -o out.tif


Options that control the reading of all images
----------------------------------------------

These are all non-positional flags that affect how all images are read in the
:program:`oiiotool` command.

.. option:: --autocc

    Turns on automatic color space conversion: Every input image file will
    be immediately converted to a scene-referred linear color space, and
    every file written will be first transformed to an appropriate output
    color space based on the filename or type.   Additionally, if the name
    of an output file contains a color space and that color space is
    associated with a particular data format, it will output that data
    format (akin to `-d`).
    
    The rules for deducing color spaces are as follows, in order of
    priority:
    
    1. If the filename (input or output) contains as a substring the name of
       a color space from the current OpenColorIO configuration, that will
       be assumed to be the color space of input data (or be the requested
       color space for output).

    2. For input files, if the ImageInput set the ``"oiio:ColorSpace"``
       metadata, it will be honored if the filename did not override it.

    3. When outputting to JPEG files, assume that sRGB is the desired output
       color space (since JPEG requires sRGB), but still this only occurs if
       the filename does not specify something different.
    
    If the implied color transformation is unknown (for example, involving a
    color space that is not recognized), a warning will be printed, but it
    the rest of `oiiotool` processing will proceed (but without having
    transformed the colors of the image).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:unpremult=` *int*
        If nonzero, when autocc is performed on an image containing an alpha
        channel, the image will first be unpremultiplied by alpha, then
        color transformed, then re-premultipled by alpha, so that the
        color transformation is done with unassociated color values. The
        default is 0, meaning that the color transformation will be done
        directly on the associated color values.

    Example:

        If the input file `in_lg10.dpx` is in the `lg10` color space,
        and you want to read it in, brighten the RGB uniformly by 10% (in a linear
        space, of course), and then save it as a 16 bit integer TIFF file encoded
        in the `vd16` color space, you could specify the conversions
        explicitly::

            oiiotool in_lg10.dpx --colorconvert lg10 linear \
                                 --mulc 1.1,1.1,1.1,1.0 -colorconvert linear vd16 \
                                 -d uint16 -o out_vd16.tif

        or rely on the naming convention matching the OCIO color space
        names and use automatic conversion::

            oiiotool --autocc in_lg10.dpx --mulc 1.1 -o out_vd16.tif

.. option:: --autopremult (default), -no-autopremult

    By default, OpenImageIO's format readers convert any "unassociated
    alpha" (color values that are not "premultiplied" by alpha) to the usual
    associated/premultiplied convention.  If the `--no-autopremult` flag is
    found, subsequent inputs will not do this premultiplication. It can be
    turned on again via `--autopremult`.

.. option:: --autoorient

    Automatically do the equivalent of `--reorient` on every image as it is
    read in, if it has a nonstandard orientation. This is generally a good idea
    to use if you are using oiiotool to combine images that may have different
    orientations.

.. option:: --native

    Normally, all images read by :program:`oiiotool` are read into an
    ImageBuf backed by an underlying ImageCache, and are automatically
    converted to `float` pixels for internal storage (because any subsequent
    image processing is usually much faster and more accurate when done on
    floating-point values).

    This option causes (1) input images to be stored internally in their
    native pixel data type rather than converted to float, and (2) to bypass
    the ImageCache (reading directly into an ImageBuf) if the pixel data
    type is not one of the types that is supported internally to ImageCache
    (`UINT8`, `uint16`, `half`, and `float`).

    images whose pixels are comprised of data types that are not natively
    representable exactly in the ImageCache to bypass the ImageCache and be
    read directly into an ImageBuf.

    The typical use case for this is when you know you are dealing with
    unusual pixel data types that might lose precision if converted to
    `float` (for example, if you have images with `uint32` or `double`
    pixels). Another use case is if you are using :program:`oiiotool` merely
    for file format or data format conversion, with no actual image
    processing math performed on the pixel values -- in that case, you might
    save time and memory by bypassing the conversion to `float`.

.. option:: --autotile <tilesize>

    For the underlying ImageCache, turn on auto-tiling with the given tile
    size. Setting *tilesize* to 0 turns off auto-tiling (the default is
    off). If auto-tile is turned on, The ImageCache "autoscanline" feature
    will also be enabled. See Section :ref:`sec-imagecache-api` for details.

.. option:: --missingfile <value>

    Determines the behavior when an input file is not found, and no file of
    that name exists at all. An error is always printed and the `oiiotool`
    program always has an error-indicating exit code. But how it proceeds
    with the rest of the commands may vary depending on the option value:

    - `error` : (default) Consider it a full error for that frame iteration.

    - `black` : After the error is printed, try to continue with the rest of
      the command, substituting an opaque black image for the missing file.

    - `checker` : After the error is printed, try to continue with the rest
       of the command, substituting a checkerboard image for the missing
       file.

    Note that the resolution, channels, and format (but not arbitrary
    metadata) of the missing file substution image will be the same as the
    first image that was successfully read. If the first image requested is
    missing (thus, nothing had been successfully read when the missing image
    is needed), it will be HD resolution, 1920x1080, RGBA.

.. option:: --info

    Print metadata information about each input image as it is read.  If
    verbose mode is turned on (`-v`), all the metadata for the image is
    printed. If verbose mode is not turned on, only the resolution and data
    format are printed.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `format=name` : The format name may be one of: `text` (default) for
      readable text, or `xml` for an XML description of the image metadata.
    - `verbose=1` : If nonzero, the information will contain all metadata,
      not just the minimal amount.

    Note that this is a non-positional flag that will cause metadata to be
    printed for every input file. There is a separate `--printinfo` action
    that immediately prints metadata about the current image at the top of
    the stack (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-printinfo`).

.. option:: --metamatch <regex>, --no-metamatch <regex>

    Regular expressions to restrict which metadata are output when using
    `oiiotool --info -v`.  The `--metamatch` expression causes only metadata
    whose name matches to print; non-matches are not output.  The
    `--no-metamatch` expression causes metadata whose name matches to be
    suppressed; others (non-matches) are printed.  It is not advised to use
    both of these options at the same time (probably nothing bad will
    happen, but it's hard to reason about the behavior in that case).

.. option:: --stats

    Print detailed statistical information about each input image as it is
    read.

    Note that this is a non-positional flag that will cause statistics to be
    printed for every input file. There is a separate `--printstats` action
    that immediately prints statistics about the current image at the top of
    the stack (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-printinfo`).

.. option:: --hash

    Print the SHA-1 hash of the pixels of each input image as it is read.

.. option:: --dumpdata

    Print to the console the numerical values of every pixel, for each input
    image as it is read.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `C=` *name* : If present, will cause the output of the data to be
      in the correct syntax of declaring a C array with the given name.
      (This was added in OpenImageIO v2.3.9.)

    - `empty=` *verbose* : If 0, will cause deep images to skip printing of
      information about pixels with no samples.

    Examples::

        $ oiiotool --dumpdata image.exr

.. _sec-oiiotool-o:

Writing images
--------------

.. option:: -o <filename>

    Outputs the current image to the named file.  This does not remove the
    current image from the image stack, it merely saves a copy of it.

    Optional appended modifiers include:
    
      `:type=` *name*
        Set the pixel data type (like `-d`) for this output image (e.g.,
        `uint8`, `uint16`, `half`, `float`, etc.).
      `:bits=` *int*
        Set the bits per pixel (if nonstandard for the datatype) for this
        output image.
      `:dither=` *int*
        Turn dither on or off for this output. When writing floating point
        data to an 8 bit or less data type in the file, dither can reduce
        banding artifacts. (default: 0)
      `:autocc=` *int*
        Enable or disable `--autocc` for this output image (the default is
        to use the global setting).
      `:unpremult=` *int*
        If autocc is used for this image, should any color transformation be
        done on unassociated colors (unpremultiplied by alpha). The default
        is 0.
      `:autocrop=` *int*
        Enable or disable autocrop for this output image.
      `:autotrim=` *int*
        Enable or disable `--autotrim` for this output image.
      `:separate=` *int*, `contig=` *int*
        Set separate or contiguous planar configuration for this output.
      `:fileformatname=` *string*
        Specify the desired output file format, overriding any guess based
        on file name extension.
      `:scanline=` *int*
        If nonzero, force scanline output.
      `:tile=` *int* `x` *int*
        Force tiling with given size.
      `:all=` *n*
        Output all images currently on the stack using a pattern.
        See further explanation below.

    The `all=n` option causes *all* images on the image stack to be output,
    with the filename argument used as a pattern assumed to contain a `%d`,
    which will be substituted with the index of the image (beginning with
    *n*). For example, to take a multi-image TIFF and extract all the
    subimages and save them as separate files::
    
        oiiotool multi.tif -sisplit -o:all=1 sub%04d.tif
    
    This will output the subimges as separate files `sub0001.tif`,
    `sub0002.tif`, and so on.


.. option:: -otex <filename>
            -oenv <filename>
            -obump <filename>

    Outputs the current image to the named file, as a MIP-mapped texture or
    environment map, identical to that which would be output by `maketx`
    (Chapter :ref:`chap-maketx`). The advantage of using :program:`oiiotool`
    rather than `maketx` is simply that you can have a complex
    :program:`oiiotool` command line sequence of image operations, culminating
    in a direct saving of the results as a texture map, rather than saving to a
    temporary file and then separately invoking `maketx`.
    
    In addition to all the optional arguments of `-o`, optional appended
    arguments for `-otex`, `-oenv`, and `-obump` also include:
    
      `:wrap=` *string*
        Set the default $s$ and $t$ wrap modes of the texture, to one of:
        `:black`, `clamp`, `periodic`, `mirror`.
      `:swrap=` *string*
        Set the default $s$ wrap mode of the texture.
      `:twrap=` *string*
        Set the default $t$ wrap mode of the texture.
      `:resize=` *int*
        If nonzero, resize to a power of 2 before starting to create the
        MIPpmap levels. (default: 0)
      `:nomipmap=` *int*
        If nonzero, do not create MIP-map levels at all. (default: 0)
      `:updatemode=` *int*
        If nonzero, do not create and overwrite the existing texture if it
        appears to already match the source pixels. (default: 0)
      `:constant_color_detect=` *int*
        Detect images that are entirely one color, and change them to be low
        resolution. (default: 0)
      `:monochrome_detect=` *int*
        Detect monochrome (R=G=B) images and turn them into 1-channel
        textures. (default: 0)
      `:opaque_detect=` *int*
        Detect opaque (A=1) images and drop the alpha channel from the
        texture. (default: 0)
      `:compute_average=` *int*
        Compute and store the average color of the texture. (default: 1)
      `:unpremult=` *int*
        Unpremultiply colors before any per-MIP-level color conversions, and
        re-premultiply after. (default: 0)
      `:incolorspace=` *string*
        Specify color space conversion.
      `:outcolorspace=` *string*
        ...
      `:highlightcomp=` *int*
        Use highlight compensation for HDR images when resizing for MIP-map
        levels. (default: 0)
      `:sharpen=` *float*
        Additional sharpening factor when resizing for MIP-map levels.
        (default: 0.0)
      `:filter=` *string*
        Specify the filter for MIP-map level resizing. (default: box)
      `:prman_metadata=` *int*
        Turn all all options required to make the resulting texture file
        compatible with PRMan (particular tile sizes, formats, options, and
        metadata). (default: 0)
      `:prman_options=` *int*
        Include the metadata that PRMan's texture system wants. (default: 0)
      `:bumpformat=` *string*
        For `-obump` only, specifies the interpretation of 3-channel source
        images as one of: `height`, `normal`, `auto` (default).
      `:uvslopes_scale=` *float*
        For `-obump` only, specifies the amount to scale the bump-map slopes
        by. (default: 0.0, meaning not to use this feature)
      `:cdf=` *int*
        If nonzero, will add to the texture metadata the forward and inverse
        Gaussian CDF, which can be used by shaders to implement
        Histogram-Preserving blending. (default: 0)
      `:cdfsigma=` *float*
        In conjunction with `cdf=1`, specifies the sigma value to use for the
        CDF (default: 1.0/6.0).
      `:cdfbits=` *int*
        In conjunction with `cdf=1`, specifies the number of bits to use for
        the size of the CDF table (default: 8, meaning 256 bins).
      `:handed=` *string*
        Specifies the handedness of a vector displacement map or normal map
        when using tangent space coordinates. Valid values are "left" or
        "right" (default: none).

    Examples::

        oiiotool in.tif -otex out.tx
    
        oiiotool in.jpg --colorconvert sRGB linear -d uint16 -otex out.tx
    
        oiiotool --pattern:checker 512x512 3 -d uint8 -otex:wrap=periodic checker.tx
    
        oiiotool in.exr -otex:hilightcomp=1:sharpen=0.5 out.exr


.. option:: -d <datatype>
            -d <channelname>=<datatype>
            -d <subimagename>.*=<datatype>
            -d <subimagename>.<channelname>=<datatype>

    Attempts to set the pixel data type of all subsequent outputs.  If no
    channel or subimage name is given, sets *all* channels to be the
    specified data type.  If a specific channel is named, then the data type
    will be overridden for just that channel (multiple `-d` commands may be
    used). If both a subimage name and channel name are specified, the hint
    is only for the named channel when encountered in a named subimage. And
    if the specification is of the form `subimagename.*=type`, then all
    channels of that subimage will be output with the given type.
    
    Valid types are: `uint8`, `sint8`, `uint16`, `sint16`, `half`, `float`,
    `double`. The types `uint10` and `uint12` may be used to request 10- or
    12-bit unsigned integers.  If the output file format does not support
    them, `uint16` will be substituted.
    
    If the `-d` option is not supplied, the output data type will be
    deduced from the data format of the input files, if possible.
    
    In any case, if the output file type does not support the requested data
    type, it will instead use whichever supported data type results in the
    least amount of precision lost.

.. option:: --scanline

    Requests that subsequent output files be scanline-oriented, if scanline
    orientation is supported by the output file format.  By default, the
    output file will be scanline if the input is scanline, or tiled if the
    input is tiled.

.. option:: --tile <x> <y>

    Requests that subsequent output files be tiled, with the given
    :math:`x \times y` tile size, if tiled images are supported by the
    output format. By default, the output file will take on the tiledness
    and tile size of the input file.

.. option:: --compression <method>
            --compression <method:quality>

    Sets the compression method, and optionally a quality setting, for the
    output image.  Each ImageOutput plugin will have its own set of methods
    that it supports.
    
    Sets the compression method, and optionally a quality setting, for the
    output image.  Each ImageOutput plugin will have its own set of methods
    that it supports.

.. option:: --quality <q>

    Sets the compression quality, on a 1-100 floating-point scale.
    This only has an effect if the particular compression method supports
    a quality metric (as JPEG does).

    .. DEPRECATED(2.1)

    This is considered deprecated, and in general we now recommend just
    appending the quality metric to the `--compression name:qual`.

.. option:: --dither

    Turns on *dither* when outputting to 8-bit or less image files (does not
    affect other data types). This adds just a bit of noise that reduces
    visible banding artifacts. The dither seed will be selected based on a
    hash of the output filename, and therefore will be a different random
    pattern for different files. It only has an effect when outputting to
    a file of 8 or fewer bits per sample, and only when the data being
    saved starts off with higher than 8 bit precision.

.. option:: --planarconfig <config>

    Sets the planar configuration of subsequent outputs (if supported by
    their formats).  Valid choices are: `config` for contiguous (or
    interleaved) packing of channels in the file (e.g., RGBRGBRGB...),
    `separate` for separate channel planes (e.g., RRRR...GGGG...BBBB...), or
    `default` for the default choice for the given format.  This command
    will be ignored for output files whose file format does not support the
    given choice.

.. option:: --adjust-time

    When this flag is present, after writing each output, the resulting
    file's modification time will be adjusted to match any `"DateTime"`
    metadata in the image.  After doing this, a directory listing will show
    file times that match when the original image was created or captured,
    rather than simply when :program:`oiiotool` was run.  This has no effect
    on image files that don't contain any `"DateTime"` metadata.

.. option:: --noautocrop

    For subsequent outputs, do *not* automatically crop images whose formats
    don't support separate pixel data and full/display windows. Without
    this, the default is that outputs will be cropped or padded with black
    as necessary when written to formats that don't support the concepts of
    pixel data windows and full/display windows.  This is a non-issue for
    file formats that support these concepts, such as OpenEXR.

.. option:: --autotrim

    For subsequent outputs, if the output format supports separate pixel
    data and full/display windows, automatically trim the output so that
    it writes the minimal data window that contains all the non-zero valued
    pixels.  In other words, trim off any all-black border rows and columns
    before writing the file.

.. option:: --metamerge

    When this flag is used, most image operations will try to merge the
    metadata found in all of their source input images into the output.
    The default (if this is not used) is that image oprations with multiple
    input images will just take metadata from the first source image.

    (This was added for OpenImageIO 2.1.)



.. _sec-oiiotool-printinfo:

:program:`oiiotool` commands that print information about the current image
===========================================================================

.. option:: --echo <message>

    Prints the message to the console, at that point in the left-to-right
    execution of command line arguments. The message may contain expressions
    for substitution.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `newline=n` : The number of newlines to print after the message
      (default is 1, but 0 will suppress the newline, and a larger number
      will make more vertical space.

    Examples::

        oiiotool test.tif --resize 256x0 --echo "result is {TOP.width}x{TOP.height}"
    
    This will resize the input to be 256 pixels wide and automatically size
    it vertically to preserve the original aspect ratio, and then print a
    message to the console revealing the resolution of the resulting image.

.. option:: --list-formats

    Prints the complete list of file formats supported by this build of
    OpenImageIO, and for each one, the list of file extensions that it
    presumes are associated with the file format. (Added in OIIO 2.2.13.)

.. option:: --printinfo

    Prints information and all metadata about the current (top) image. This
    behavior is similar to invoking oiiotool with :option:`--info -v`, but it
    applies immediately to the current top image, even if it is a "computed"
    image (whereas :option:`--info` only applies to images as they are read
    from disk).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `:allsubimages=` *int*
        If nonzero, stats will be printed about all subimages of the current
        image. (The default is given by whether or not the `-a` option was
        used.)

    - `:native=1`
        Print metadata reflecting the "native" image as it was originally
        read from disk. This may have a data type, tile size, or other
        items that differ from the current in-memory representation of
        the image.

    - `:stats=1`
        Print statistics about the image (much like the :option:`--stats`
        command).

    - `:verbose=0`
        Overrides the default verbosity (1, on) with a less verbose output.


.. option:: --printstats

    Prints detailed statistical information about the current image. This
    behavior is similar to invoking oiiotool with :option:`--stats`, but it
    applies immediately to the current top image, even if it is a "computed"
    image (whereas :option:`--stats` only applies to images as they are read
    from disk).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `:window=` *geom*
        If present, restricts the statistics to a rectangular subset of the
        image. The default, if not present is to print the statistics of the
        full data window of the image. The rectangle can be specified using
        either of these image geometry notations:

            *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

            *xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax*

    - `:allsubimages=` *int*
        If nonzero, stats will be printed about all subimages of the current
        image. (The default is given by whether or not the `-a` option was
        used.)

.. option:: --colorcount r1,g1,b1,...:r2,g2,b2,...:...

    Given a list of colors separated by colons or semicolons, where each
    color is a list of comma-separated values (for each channel), examine
    all pixels of the current image and print a short report of how many
    pixels matched each of the colors.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `eps=r,g,b,...` : Tolerance for matching colors (default:
      0.001 for all channels).

    Examples::

        oiiotool test.tif --colorcount "0.792,0,0,1;0.722,0,0,1"

    might produce the following output::

        10290  0.792,0,0,1
        11281  0.722,0,0,1

    Notice that use of double quotes `" "` around the list of color
    arguments, in order to make sure that the command shell does not
    interpret the semicolon (`;`) as a statement separator.  An alternate
    way to specify multiple colors is to separate them with a colon (`:`),
    for example::

        oiiotool test.tif --colorcount 0.792,0,0,1:0.722,0,0,1

    Another example::

        oiiotool test.tif --colorcount:eps=.01,.01,.01,1000 "0.792,0,0,1"

    This example sets a larger epsilon for the R, G, and B channels (so
    that, for example, a pixel with value [0.795,0,0] would also match), and
    by setting the epsilon to 1000 for the alpha channel, it effectively
    ensures that alpha will not be considered in the matching of pixels to
    the color value.

.. option:: --rangecheck Rlow,Glow,Blow,...  Rhi,Bhi,Ghi,...

    Given a two colors (each a comma-separated list of values for each
    channel), print a count of the number of pixels in the image that has
    channel values outside the [low,hi] range.  Any channels not
    specified will assume a low of 0.0 and high of 1.0.

    Example::

        oiiotool test.exr --rangecheck 0,0,0 1,1,1

    might produce the following output::

            0  < 0,0,0
          221  > 1,1,1
        65315  within range

.. option:: --diff
            --fail <A> --failpercent <B> --hardfail <C>
            --warn <A> --warnpercent <B> --hardwarn <C>

    This command computes the difference of the current image and the next
    image on the stack, and prints a report of those differences (how
    many pixels differed, the maximum amount, etc.).  This command does not
    alter the image stack.
    
    The `--fail`, `--failpercent`, and `--hardfail` options set thresholds
    for `FAILURE`: if more than *B* % of pixels (on a 0-100 floating point
    scale) are greater than *A* different, or if *any* pixels are more than
    *C* different.  The defaults are to fail if more than 0% (any) pixels
    differ by more than 0.00001 (1e-6), and *C* is infinite.
    
    The `--warn`, `--warnpercent`, and `hardwarn` options set thresholds for
    `WARNING`: if more than *B* % of pixels (on a 0-100 floating point scale)
    are greater than *A* different, or if *any* pixels are more than *C*
    different.  The defaults are to warn if more than 0% (any) pixels differ
    by more than 0.00001 (1e-6), and *C* is infinite.

.. option:: --pdiff

    This command computes the difference of the current image and the next
    image on the stack using a perceptual metric, and prints whether or not
    they match according to that metric.  This command does not alter the
    image stack.



:program:`oiiotool` commands that change the current image metadata
===================================================================

This section describes :program:`oiiotool` commands that alter the metadata
of the current image, but do not alter its pixel values.  Only the current
(i.e., top of stack) image is affected, not any images further down the
stack.

If the `-a` flag has previously been set, these commands apply to all
subimages or MIPmap levels of the current top image.  Otherwise, they only
apply to the highest-resolution MIPmap level of the first subimage of the
current top image.

.. option:: --attrib <name> <value>
            --sattrib <name> <value>

    Adds or replaces metadata with the given *name* to have the specified
    *value*.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).
        Only included subimages will have the attribute changed. If subimages
        are not set, only the first subimage will be changed, or all subimages
        if the `-a` command line flag was used.

      `:type=` *typename* : Specify the metadata type.

    If the optional `type=` specifier is used, that provides an explicit
    type for the metadata. If not provided, it will try to infer the type of
    the metadata from the value: if the value contains only numerals (with
    optional leading minus sign), it will be saved as `int` metadata; if it
    also contains a decimal point, it will be saved as `float` metadata;
    otherwise, it will be saved as a `string` metadata.
    
    The `--sattrib` command is equivalent to `--attrib:type=string`.

    Examples::

        # Set the IPTC:City attribute to "Berkeley"
        oiiotool in.jpg --attrib "IPTC:City" "Berkeley" -o out.jpg
    
        # Set a name attribute to "0", but force it to be a string
        oiiotool in.jpg --attrib:type=string "Name" "0" -o out.jpg
    
        # Another way to force a string attribute using --sattrib:
        oiiotool in.jpg --sattrib "Name" "0" -o out.jpg
    
        # Set the worldcam attribute to be a matrix
        oiiotool in.exr --attrib:type=matrix worldtocam \
                "1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2.3,2.1,0,1" -o out.exr

        # Set an attribute to be a timecode    
        oiiotool in.exr --attrib:type=timecode smpte:TimeCode "11:34:04:00" -o out.exr

        # Set an attribute in all subimages
        oiiotool multipart.exr --attrib:subimages=all "Foo" "bar" -o out.exr

        # Set an attribute just in subimages 0 and 3
        oiiotool multipart.exr --attrib:subimages=0,3 "Foo" "bar" -o out.exr

.. option:: --caption <text>

    Sets the image metadata `"ImageDescription"`. This has no effect if the
    output image format does not support some kind of title, caption, or
    description metadata field. Be careful to enclose *text* in quotes if you
    want your caption to include spaces or certain punctuation!

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).
        Only included subimages will have the attribute changed. If subimages
        are not set, only the first subimage will be changed, or all subimages
        if the `-a` command line flag was used.

.. option:: --keyword <text>

    Adds a keyword to the image metadata `"Keywords"`.  Any existing
    keywords will be preserved, not replaced, and the new keyword will not
    be added if it is an exact duplicate of existing keywords.  This has no
    effect if the output image format does not support some kind of keyword
    field.

    Be careful to enclose *text* in quotes if you want your keyword to
    include spaces or certain punctuation.  For image formats that have only
    a single field for keywords, OpenImageIO will concatenate the keywords,
    separated by semicolon (`;`), so don't use semicolons within your
    keywords.

.. option:: --clear-keywords

    Clears all existing keywords in the current image.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).
        Only included subimages will have the attribute changed. If subimages
        are not set, only the first subimage will be changed, or all subimages
        if the `-a` command line flag was used.

.. option:: --nosoftwareattrib

    When set, this prevents the normal adjustment of "Software" and
    "ImageHistory" metadata to reflect what :program:`oiiotool` is doing.

.. option:: --sansattrib

    When set, this edits the command line inserted in the "Software" and
    "ImageHistory" metadata to omit any verbose `--attrib` and `--sattrib`
    commands.

.. option:: --eraseattrib <pattern>

    Removes any metadata whose name matches the regular expression *pattern*.
    The pattern will be case insensitive.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).
        Only included subimages will have the attribute changed. If subimages
        are not set, only the first subimage will be changed, or all subimages
        if the `-a` command line flag was used.

    Examples::

        # Remove one item only
        oiiotool in.jpg --eraseattrib "smpte:TimeCode" -o no_timecode.jpg
    
        # Remove all GPS tags
        oiiotool in.jpg --eraseattrib "GPS:.*" -o no_gps_metadata.jpg
    
        # Remove all metadata
        oiiotool in.exr --eraseattrib:subimages=all ".*" -o no_metadata.exr


.. option:: --orientation <orient>

    Explicitly sets the image's `"Orientation"` metadata to a numeric value
    (see Section :ref:`sec-metadata-displayhints` for the numeric codes). This
    only changes the metadata field that specifies how the image should be
    displayed, it does NOT alter the pixels themselves, and so has no effect
    for image formats that don't support some kind of orientation metadata.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).
        Only included subimages will have the attribute changed. If subimages
        are not set, only the first subimage will be changed, or all subimages
        if the `-a` command line flag was used.

.. option:: --orientcw
            --orientccw
            --orient180

    Adjusts the image's `"Orientation"` metadata by rotating the suggested
    viewing orientation :math:`90^\circ` clockwise, :math:`90^\circ` degrees
    counter-clockwise, or :math:`180^\circ`, respectively, compared to its
    current setting.  This only changes the metadata field that specifies
    how the image should be displayed, it does NOT alter the pixels
    themselves, and so has no effect for image formats that don't support
    some kind of orientation metadata.
    
    See the `--rotate90`, `--rotate180`, `--rotate270`, and `--reorient`
    commands for true rotation of the pixels (not just the metadata).

.. option:: --origin <neworigin>

    Set the pixel data window origin, essentially translating the existing
    pixel data window to a different position on the image plane.
    The new data origin is in the form::
    
         [+-]x[+-]y

    Examples::

        --origin +20+10           x=20, y=10
        --origin +0-40            x=0, y=-40


.. option:: --originoffset <offset>

    Alter the data window origin, translating the existing pixel data window
    by this relative amount.
    The offset is in the form::
    
         [+-]x[+-]y

    Examples::

        # Assuming the old origin was +100+20...
        --originoffset +20+10           # new x=120, y=30
        --originoffset +0-40            # new x=100, y=-20


.. option:: --fullsize <size>

    Set the display/full window size and/or offset.  The size is in the
    form

        *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

    If either the offset or resolution is omitted, it will remain
    unchanged.

    Examples:

    ============================  ============================================
    `--fullsize 1920x1080`        resolution w=1920, h=1080, offset unchanged
    `--fullsize -20-30`           resolution unchanged, x=-20, y=-30
    `--fullsize 1024x768+100+0`   resolution w=1024, h=768, offset x=100, y=0
    ============================  ============================================


.. option:: --fullpixels

    Set the full/display window range to exactly cover the pixel data
    window.

.. option:: --chnames <name-list>

    Rename some or all of the channels of the top image to the given
    comma-separated list.  Any completely empty channel names in the
    list will not be changed.  For example::

        oiiotool in.exr --chnames ",,,A,Z" -o out.exr

    will rename channel 3 to be "A" and channel 4 to be
    "Z", but will leave channels 0--3 with their old names.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).
        Only included subimages will have their channels renamed.


.. _sec-oiiotool-shuffle-channels-or-subimages:

:program:`oiiotool` commands that shuffle channels or subimages
===============================================================

.. option:: --selectmip <level>

    If the current image is MIP-mapped, replace the current image with a new
    image consisting of only the given *level* of the MIPmap. Level 0 is the
    highest resolution version, level 1 is the next-lower resolution
    version, etc.

.. option:: --unmip

    If the current image is MIP-mapped, discard all but the top level (i.e.,
    replacing the current image with a new image consisting of only the
    highest-resolution level).  Note that this is equivalent to `--selectmip
    0`.

.. option:: --subimage <n>

    If the current image has multiple subimages, replace it with just the
    specified subimage. The subimage specifier *n* is either an integer
    giving the index of the subimage to extract (starting with 0), or the
    *name* of the subimage to extract (comparing to the
    `"oiio:subimagename"` metadata).

    Additionally, this command can be used to remove one subimage (leaving
    the others) by using the optional modifier `--subimage:delete=1`.

.. option:: --sisplit

    Remove the top image from the stack, split it into its constituent
    subimages, and push them all onto the stack (first to last).

.. option:: --siappend

    Replaces the top two (or more) images on the stack with a single new
    multi-subimage comprised of the original images appended together as
    subimages within the same single image.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:n=` *number-of-subimages*
        Specify the number (if more than 2) of images to combine into a
        single multi-subimage image. This will be clamped between 2 and the
        total number of images on the stack.

.. option:: --siappendall

    Replace *all* of the individual images on the stack with a single new
    image comprised of the subimages of all original images appended
    together.

.. option:: --ch <channellist>

    Replaces the top image with a new image whose channels have been
    reordered as given by the *channellist*.  The `channellist` is a
    comma-separated list of channel designations, each of which may be

    * an integer channel index of the channel to copy,
    * the name of a channel to copy,
    * *newname* `=` *oldname*, which copies a named channel and also renames
      it,
    * `=` *float*, which will set the channel to a constant value, or
    * *newname* `=` *float*, which sets the channel to a constant value as
      well as names the new channel.

    Example channel lists include: `R,G,B`, `R=0.0,G,B,A=1.0`, `R=B,G,B=R`,
    `4,5,6,A`.

    Channel numbers outside the valid range of input channels, or unknown
    names, will be replaced by black channels. If the *channellist* is
    shorter than the number of channels in the source image, unspecified
    channels will be omitted.

    If the channel list does not specify any changes (neither order, nor
    name, nor value), then this will just leave the images as-is, without
    any unnecessary expense or pointless copying of images in memory.

.. option:: --chappend

    Replaces the top two (or more) images on the stack with a single new
    image comprised of the channels of the input images appended together.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:n=` *number-of-subimages*
        Specify the number (if more than 2) of images whose channels should
        be combined into a single image. This will be clamped between 2 and
        the total number of images on the stack.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).



:program:`oiiotool` commands that adjust the image stack
========================================================

.. option:: --pop

    Pop the image stack, discarding the current image and thereby making the
    next image on the stack into the new current image.

.. option:: --dup

    Duplicate the current image and push the duplicate on the stack. Note
    that this results in both the current and the next image on the stack
    being identical copies.

.. option:: --swap

    Swap the current image and the next one on the stack.

.. option:: --label <name>

    Gives a name to (and saves) the current image at the top of the stack.
    Thereafter, the label name may be used to refer to that saved image, in
    the usual manner that an ordinary input image would be specified by
    filename.


:program:`oiiotool` commands that make entirely new images
==========================================================

.. option:: --create <size> <channels>

    Create new black image with the given size and number of channels,
    pushing it onto the image stack and making it the new current image.
    
    The *size* is in the form
    
        *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

    If the offset is omitted, it will be x=0, y=0. Optional appended
    arguments include:

    - `type=` *name* : Create the image in memory with the named data type
      (default: float).

    Examples::

        --create 1920x1080 3         # RGB with w=1920, h=1080, x=0, y=0
        --create 1024x768+100+0 4    # RGBA with w=1024, h=768, x=100, y=0
        --create:type=uint8 1920x1080 3  # RGB, store internally as uint8


.. option:: --pattern <patternname> <size> <channels>

    Create new image with the given size and number of channels,
    initialize its pixels to the named pattern, and push it onto 
    the image stack to make it the new current image.

    The *size* is in the form

        *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

    If the offset is omitted, it will be x=0, y=0. Optional appended
    arguments include:

    - `type=` *name* : Create the image in memory with the named data type
      (default: float).

    The patterns recognized include the following:

    * `black`  : A black image (all pixels 0.0)
    * `constant`  : A constant color image, defaulting to white, but the
      color can be set with the optional `:color=r,g,b,...` arguments giving
      a numerical value for each channel.
    * `checker` : A black and white checkerboard pattern.  The optional
      modifier `:width=` sets the width of the checkers (defaulting to 8
      pixels), `:height=` sets the height of the checkers (defaulting to equal
      height and width). Optional modifiers `:color1=r,g,b,...` and
      `:color2=r,g,b,...` set the colors of the alternating squares
      (defaulting to black and white, respectively).
    * `fill`  : A constant color or gradient, depending on the optional
      colors. Argument `:color=r,g,b,...` results in a constant color.
      Argument `:top=r,g,b,...:bottom=...` results in a top-to-bottom
      gradient. Argument `:left=r,g,b,...:right=...` results in a
      left-to-right gradient. Argument
      `:topleft=r,g,b,...:topright=...:bottomleft=...:bottomright=...`
      results in a 4-corner bilinear gradient.
    * `noise` : Create a noise image, with the option `:type=` specifying
      the kind of noise: (1) `gaussian` (default) for normal distribution
      noise with mean and standard deviation given by `:mean=` and `:stddev=`,
      respectively (defaulting to 0 and 0.1); (2) `white` (or `uniform`) for
      uniformly-distributed white noise over the range of values given by
      options `:min=` and `:max=` (defaults: 0 and 0.1); (3) `blue` for
      uniformly-distributed blue noise over the range of values given by
      options `:min=` and `:max=` (defaults: 0 and 0.1); (4) `salt` for "salt
      and pepper" noise where a portion of pixels given by option `portion=`
      (default: 0.1) is replaced with value given by option `value=` (default:
      0). For any of these noise types, the option `seed=` can be used to
      change the random number seed and `mono=1` can be used to make
      monochromatic noise (same value in all channels).
    
    Examples:
    
        A constant 4-channel, 640x480 image with all pixels (0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 1)::

            --pattern constant:color=0.3,0.5,0.1,1.0 640x480 4

        A 256x256 RGB image with a 16-pixel-wide checker pattern::

            --pattern checker:width=16:height=16 256x256 3

        .. image:: figures/checker.jpg
            :align: center
            :width: 1.5in
        |

        Horizontal, vertical, or 4-corner gradients::

            --pattern fill:top=0.1,0.1,0.1:bottom=0,0,0.5 640x480 3
            --pattern fill:left=0.1,0.1,0.1:right=0,0.75,0 640x480 3
            --pattern fill:topleft=.1,.1,.1:topright=1,0,0:bottomleft=0,1,0:botromright=0,0,1 640x480 3

        .. image:: figures/gradient.jpg
            :width: 2.0in
        .. image:: figures/gradienth.jpg
            :width: 2.0in
        .. image:: figures/gradient4.jpg
            :width: 2.0in

        |

        The first example puts uniform noise independently in 3 channels, while the
        second generates a single greyscale noise and replicates it in all channels.

        .. code-block::

            oiiotool --pattern noise:type=uniform:min=1:max=1 256x256 3 -o colornoise.jpg
            oiiotool --pattern noise:type=uniform:min=0:max=1:mono=1 256x256 3 -o greynoise.jpg}
        ..

            .. image:: figures/unifnoise3.jpg
               :height: 1.5 in
            .. image:: figures/unifnoise1.jpg
               :height: 1.5 in

        Generate Gaussian noise with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.2 for
        each channel::

            oiiotool --pattern noise:type=gaussian:mean=0.5:stddev=0.2 256x256 3 -o gaussnoise.jpg
        ..

            .. image:: figures/gaussnoise.jpg
               :height: 2.0 in


.. option:: --kernel <name> <size>

    Create new 1-channel `float` image big enough to hold the named kernel
    and size (size is expressed as *width* x *height*, e.g. `5x5`).  The
    *width* and *height* are allowed to be floating-point numbers. The
    kernel image will have its origin offset so that the kernel center is at
    (0,0), and and will be normalized (the sum of all pixel values will be
    1.0).
    
    Kernel names can be: `gaussian`, `sharp-gaussian`, `box`, `triangle`,
    `blackman-harris`, `mitchell`, `b-spline`, `cubic`, `keys`, `simon`,
    `rifman`, `disk`. There are also `catmull-rom` and `lanczos3` (and its
    synonym, `nuke-lanczos6`), but they are fixed-size kernels that don't
    scale with the width, and are therefore probably less useful in most
    cases.

    Examples::

        oiiotool --kernel gaussian 11x11 -o gaussian.exr



.. option:: --capture

    Capture a frame from a camera device, pushing it onto the image stack
    and making it the new current image.  Optional appended arguments
    include:
    
    - `camera=` *num* : Select which camera number to capture (default: 0).

    Examples::

        --capture               # Capture from the default camera
        --capture:camera=1      # Capture from camera #1


:program:`oiiotool` commands that do image processing
=====================================================

.. option:: --add
            --addc <value>
            --addc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the pixel-by-pixel
    sum of those images (`--add`), or add a constant color value to all
    pixels in the top image (`--addc`).
    
    For `--addc`, if a single constant value is given, it will be added to
    all color channels. Alternatively, a series of comma-separated constant
    values (with no spaces!) may be used to specify a different value to
    add to each channel in the image.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool imageA.tif imageB.tif --add -o sum.jpg

    .. code-block::

        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --addc 0.5 -o addc.jpg
    ..

        .. image:: figures/tahoe-small.jpg
            :width: 2.0 in
        .. image:: figures/addc.jpg
            :width: 2.0 in
    |


.. option:: --sub
            --subc <value>
            --subc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the pixel-by-pixel
    difference between the first and second images (`--sub`), or subtract a
    constant color value from all pixels in the top image (`--subc`).
    
    For `--subc`, if a single constant value is given, it will be subtracted
    from all color channels. Alternatively, a series of comma-separated
    constant values (with no spaces!) may be used to specify a different
    value to subtract from each channel in the image.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --mul
            --mulc <value>
            --mulc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the pixel-by-pixel
    multiplicative product of those images (`--mul`), or multiply all pixels
    in the top image by a constant value (`--mulc`).
    
    For `--mulc`, if a single constant value is given, it will be multiplied
    to all color channels. Alternatively, a series of comma-separated
    constant values (with no spaces!) may be used to specify a different
    value to multiply with each channel in the image.
    
    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::
    
        # Scale image brightness to 20% of its original
        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --mulc 0.2 -o mulc.jpg
    ..

        .. image:: figures/tahoe-small.jpg
            :width: 2.0 in
        .. image:: figures/mulc.jpg
            :width: 2.0 in
        |


.. option:: --div
            --divc <value>
            --divc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the
    pixel-by-pixel, channel-by-channel result of the first image divided by
    the second image (`--div`), or divide all pixels in the top image by a
    constant value (`--divc`). Division by zero is defined as resulting in
    0.
    
    For `--divc`, if a single constant value is given, all color channels
    will have their values divided by the same value.  Alternatively, a
    series of comma-separated constant values (with no spaces!) may be used
    to specify a different multiplier for each channel in the image,
    respectively.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --mad

    Replace the *three* top images A, B, and C (C being the top of stack, B
    below it, and A below B), and compute `A*B+C`, placing the result on the
    stack. Note that `A B C --mad` is equivalent to `A B --mul C --add`,
    though using `--mad` may be somewhat faster and preserve more precision.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --invert

    Replace the top image with its color inverse. By default, it only
    inverts the first three channels in order to preserve alpha, but you
    can override the channel range of the inversion with optional modifiers
    `chbegin` and `chend`. Channels outside this range will simply be
    copied, without inversion.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:chbegin=` *int*
        Override the beginning of the range of channels to be inverted
        (defaults to 0.)

      `:chend=` *int*
        Override the end of the range of channels to be inverted (defaults
        to 3). Remember that this is one more than the index of the last
        channel to be inverted.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::
    
       oiiotool tahoe.jpg --inverse -o inverse.jpg
    ..

        .. image:: figures/tahoe-small.jpg
            :width: 2.0 in
        .. image:: figures/invert.jpg
            :width: 2.0 in



.. option:: --absdiff
            --absdiffc <value>
            --absdiffc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the absolute value
    of the difference between the first and second images (`--absdiff`), or
    replace the top image by the absolute value of the difference between
    each pixel and a constant color (`--absdiffc`).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --abs

    Replace the current image with a new image that has each pixel
    consisting of the *absolute value* of the old pixel value.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --powc <value>
            --powc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Raise all the pixel values in the top image to a constant power value.
    If a single constant value is given, all color channels will have their
    values raised to this power.  Alternatively, a series of comma-separated
    constant values (with no spaces!) may be used to specify a different
    exponent for each channel in the image, respectively.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --noise

    Alter the top image to introduce noise, with the option `:type=`
    specifying the kind of noise: (1) `gaussian` (default) for normal
    distribution noise with mean and standard deviation given by `:mean=` and
    `:stddev=`, respectively (defaulting to 0 and 0.1); (2) `white` (or
    `uniform`) for uniformly-distributed independent noise over the range of
    values given by options `:min=` and `:max=` (defaults: 0 and 0.1); (3)
    `blue` is also uniformly distributed between `:min=` and `:max=`
    (defaults: 0 and 0.1), but rather than independent values, low frequencies
    are suppressed; (4) `salt` for "salt and pepper" noise where a portion of
    pixels given by  option `portion=` (default: 0.1) is replaced with value
    given by option `value=` (default: 0).
    
    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:seed=` *int*
        Can be used to change the random number seed.

      `:mono=1`
        Make monochromatic noise (same value in all channels).

      `:nchannels=` *int*
        Limit which channels are affected by the noise.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::
    
        # Add color gaussian noise to an image
        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --noise:type=gaussian:stddev=0.1 -o noisy.jpg
    
        # Simulate bad pixels by turning 1% of pixels black, but only in RGB
        # channels (leave A alone)
        oiiotool tahoe-rgba.tif --noise:type=salt:value=0:portion=0.01:mono=1:nchannels=3 \

.. option:: --chsum

    Replaces the top image by a copy that contains only 1 color channel,
    whose value at each pixel is the sum of all channels of the original
    image.  Using the optional weight allows you to customize the
    weight of each channel in the sum.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `weight=` *r,g,...*
        Specify the weight of each channel (default: 1).

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::

        oiiotool RGB.tif --chsum:weight=.2126,.7152,.0722 -o luma.tif

.. option:: --contrast

    Remap pixel values from [black, white] to [min, max], with an optional
    smooth sigmoidal contrast stretch as well.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `black=` *vals*
        Specify black value(s), default 0.0.
      `white=` *vals*
        Specify white value(s), default 1.0.
      `min=` *vals*
        Specify the minimum range value(s), default 0.0.
      `max=` *vals*
        Specify the maximum range value(s), default 1.0.
      `scontrast=` *vals*
        Specify sigmoidal contrast slope value(s),
      default 1.0.
      `sthresh=` *vals*
        Specify sigmoidal threshold value(s) giving the position of maximum
        slope, default 0.5.
      `clamp=` *on*
        If *on* is nonzero, will optionally clamp all result channels to
        [min,max].
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Each *vals* may be either a single floating point value for all
    channels, or a comma-separated list of per-channel values.

    Examples::

        oiiotool tahoe.tif --contrast:black=0.1:white=0.75 -o linstretch.tif
        oiiotool tahoe.tif --contrast:black=1.0:white=0.0:clamp=0 -o inverse.tif

.. option:: --saturate <scale>

    Scale the saturation of the first three color channels of the image by
    the scale: 0.0 fully desaturates the image into its greyscale luminance
    equivalent image, 1.0 leaves the image unchanged, `scale` values inside
    this range interpolate between them, and `scale` > 1 would increase
    apparent color saturation.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool tahoe.exr --saturate 0 -o grey.exr
        oiiotool tahoe.exr --saturate 2 -o colorful.exr

      +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

    This command was added in OIIO 2.4.



.. option:: --colormap <mapname>

    Creates an RGB color map based on the luminance of the input image. The
    `mapname` may be one of: "magma", "inferno", "plasma", "viridis", "turbo",
    "blue-red", "spectrum", and "heat". Or, `mapname` may also be a
    comma-separated list of RGB triples, to form a custom color map curve.
    
    Note that "magma", "inferno", "plasma", "viridis" are perceptually
    uniform, strictly increasing in luminance, look good when converted to
    grayscale, and work for people with all types of colorblindness. The
    "turbo" color map also shares all of these qualities except for being
    strictly increasing in luminance. These
    are all desirable qualities that are lacking in the other, older,
    crappier maps (blue-red, spectrum, and heat). Don't be fooled by the
    flashy "spectrum" colors --- it is an empirically bad color map compared
    to the preferred ones.
    
    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::
    
        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --colormap inferno -o inferno.jpg
        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --colormap viridis -o viridis.jpg
        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --colormap turbo -o turbo.jpg

.. option:: --paste <location>

    Takes two images -- the first is the "foreground" and the second is the
    "background" -- and uses the pixels of the foreground to replace those
    of the background, with foreground pixel (0,0) being pasted to the
    background at the *location* specified (expressed as `+xpos+ypos`, e.g.,
    `+100+50`, or of course using `-` for negative offsets). Only pixels
    within the actual data region of the foreground image are pasted in this
    manner.

    Note that if location is +0+0, the foreground image's data region will
    be copied to its same position in the background image (this is useful
    if you are pasting an image that already knows its correct data window
    offset).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `mergeroi=1` : If the value is nonzero, the result image will be sized
      to be the *union* of the input images (versus being the same data
      window as the background image). (The `mergeroi` modifier was added in
      OIIO 2.1.)

    - `all=1` : If the value is nonzero, will paste *all* images on the
      image stack, not just the top two images. This can be useful to
      paste-merge many images at once, for example, if you have rendered a
      large image in abutting tiles and wish to re-assemble them into a
      single image.  (The `all` modifier was added in OIIO 2.1.)

    Examples::

        # Result will be the size of bg, but with fg on top and with an
        # offset of (100,100).
        oiiotool fg.exr bg.exr -paste +100+100 -o out.exr

        # Use "merge" mode, so result will be sized to contain both fg
        # and bg. Also, paste fg into its natural position given by its
        # data window.
        oiiotool fg.exr bg.exr -paste:mergeroi=1 +0+0 -o out.exr

        # Merge many non-overlapping "tiles" into one combined image
        oiiotool img*.exr -paste:mergeroi=1:all=1 +0+0 -o combined.exr


.. option:: --pastemeta <location>

    Takes two images -- the first will be a source of metadata only, and the
    second the source of pixels -- and produces a new copy of the second
    image with the metadata from the first image added.

    The output image's pixels will come only from the second input. Metadata
    from the second input will be preserved if no identically-named metadata
    was present in the first input image.

    Examples::

        # Add all the metadata from meta.exr to pixels.exr and write the
        # combined image to out.exr.
        oiiotool meta.exr pixels.exr --pastemeta -o out.exr


.. option:: --mosaic <size>

    Removes :math:`w \times h` images from the stack, dictated by the *size*,
    and turns them into a single image mosaic -- an image that comprises
    :math:`w \times h` "cells" each containing one of the constituent
    images.

    If there are fewer images on the stack than the number of cells requested,
    the last cells will be black.

    By default, the size of the "cell" is simply the largest of the
    constituent images, but the optional `fit` parameter can instead dictate
    the cell size and constituent images will be resized to fit this cell
    size.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `fit=` *WxH* : Sets the dimensions to which the constituent images
      will be resized as they are assembled into the mosaic.

    - `pad=` *num* : Select the number of pixels of black padding to add
      between images (default: 0).

    Examples::

        oiiotool left.tif right.tif --mosaic:pad=16 2x1 -o out.tif

        oiiotool 0.tif 1.tif 2.tif 3.tif 4.tif --mosaic:pad=16:fit=320x240 2x2 -o out.tif

.. option:: --over

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the Porter/Duff
    "over" composite with the first image as the foreground and the second
    image as the background. Both input images must have the same number and
    order of channels and must contain an alpha channel.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --zover

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is a *depth
    composite* of the two images -- the operation is the Porter/Duff "over"
    composite, but each pixel individually will choose which of the two
    images is the foreground and which background, depending on the "Z"
    channel values for that pixel (larger Z means farther away). Both input
    images must have the same number and order of channels and must contain
    both depth/Z and alpha channels. Optional appended modifiers include:
    
      `zeroisinf=` *num*
        If nonzero, indicates that z=0 pixels should be treated as if they
        were infinitely far away. (The default is 0, meaning that "zero
        means zero."").
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --rotate90

    Replace the current image with a new image that is rotated 90 degrees
    clockwise.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --rotate270

    Replace the current image with a new image that is rotated 270 degrees
    clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::

.. option:: --flip

    Replace the current image with a new image that is flipped vertically,
    with the top scanline becoming the bottom, and vice versa.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::

    Replace the current image with a new image that is flopped horizontally,
    with the leftmost column becoming the rightmost, and vice versa.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

       :width: 1.5 in


.. option:: --reorient

    Replace the current image with a new image that is rotated and/or flipped
    as necessary to move the pixels to match the Orientation metadata
    that describes the desired display orientation.
    
    Example::
    
        oiiotool tahoe.jpg --reorient -o oriented.jpg
    

.. option:: --transpose

    Replace the current image with a new image that is reflected about
    the x-y axis (x and y coordinates and sizes are swapped).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::

        oiiotool grid.jpg --transpose -o transpose.jpg

    ..

       :width: 1.5 in
    .. image:: figures/transpose.jpg
       :width: 1.5 in

.. option:: --cshift <offset>

    Circularly shift the pixels of the image by the given offset (expressed
    as `+10+100` to move by 10 pixels horizontally and 100 pixels
    vertically, or `+50-30` to move by 50 pixels horizontally and -30
    pixels vertically.  *Circular* shifting means that the pixels wrap to
    the other side as they shift.
    
    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::
    
        oiiotool grid.jpg --cshift +70+30 -o cshift.jpg

       :width: 1.5 in
    .. image:: figures/cshift.jpg
       :width: 1.5 in

.. option:: --crop <size>

    Replace the current image with a new copy with the given *size*,
    cropping old pixels no longer needed, padding black pixels where they
    previously did not exist in the old image, and adjusting the offsets
    if requested.
    
    The size is in the form 

        *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

    or

        *xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax*

    Note that `crop` does not *reposition* pixels, it only trims or pads to
    reset the image's pixel data window to the specified region.
    
    If :program:`oiiotool`'s global `-a` flag is used (**all** subimages),
    or if the optional `--crop:allsubimages=1` is employed, the crop will be
    applied identically to all subimages.

    Examples::

        # Both of these crop to a 100x120 region that begins at x=35,y=40
        oiiotool tahoe.exr --crop 100x120+35+40 -o crop.exr
        oiiotool tahoe.exr --crop 35,40,134,159 -o crop.exr

       :width: 1.5 in
    .. image:: figures/crop.jpg
       :width: 1.5 in

.. option:: --croptofull

    Replace the current image with a new image that is cropped or padded
    as necessary to make the pixel data window exactly cover
    the full/display window.

.. option:: --trim

    Replace the current image with a new image that is cropped to contain the
    minimal rectangular ROI that contains all of the nonzero-valued pixels of
    the original image.

    Examples::

        oiiotool greenrect.exr -trim -o trimmed.jpg
    
        .. image:: figures/pretrim.jpg
           :width: 1.5 in
        .. image:: figures/trim.jpg
           :width: 1.5 in

.. option:: --cut <size>

    Replace the current image with a new copy with the given *size*,
    cropping old pixels no longer needed, padding black pixels where they
    previously did not exist in the old image, repositioning the cut region
    at the image origin (0,0) and resetting the full/display window to be
    identical to the new pixel data window.  (In other words, `--cut` is
    equavalent to `--crop` followed by `--origin +0+0 --fullpixels`.)

    The size is in the form

        *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

    or

        *xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax*

    Examples::
    
        # Both of these crop to a 100x120 region that begins at x=35,y=40

.. option:: --resample <size>

    Replace the current image with a new image that is resampled to the
    given pixel data resolution rapidly, but at a low quality, either by
    simple bilinear interpolation or by just copying the "closest" pixel.
    The size is in the form of any of these:
    
            *width* x *height*

            *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

            *xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax*

            *wscale% x hscale%*
    
    if `width` or `height` is 0, that dimension will be automatically
    computed so as to preserve the original aspect ratio.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `interp=` *bool*
        If set to zero, it will just copy the "closest" pixel; if nonzero,
        bilinear interpolation of the surrounding 4 pixels will be used.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples (suppose that the original image is 640x480)::
    
        --resample 1024x768         # new resolution w=1024, h=768
        --resample 50%              # reduce resolution to 320x240
        --resample 300%             # increase resolution to 1920x1440
        --resample 400x0            # new resolution will be 400x300
    

.. option:: --resize <size>

    Replace the current image with a new image whose display (full) size is
    the given pixel data resolution and offset.  The *size* is in the form

            *width* x *height*

            *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

            *xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax*

            *scale%*

            *wscale% x hscale%*

    If `width` or `height` is 0, that dimension will be automatically computed
    so as to preserve the original aspect ratio.

    By default, the scaling that occurs is to map the *full/display* window
    area of the input image to the full/display window of the output image
    (determined by the `size` argument). However, a more general warping
    can be specified using any of the `:from=`, `:to=`, or `:offset=`
    optional modifiers. (These modifiers were added in OpenmageIO 2.5.)

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:from=` *size*
        The region (specified in any of the same forms as the *size* argument,
        with decimal / partial pixel sizes and offsets allowed) of the source
        image that defines the transformational mapping. This defaults to the
        full/display window of the source image.

      `:to=` *size*
        The region (specified in any of the same forms as the *size* argument,
        with decimal / partial pixel sizes and offsets allowed) of the
        destination image that defines the transformational mapping. This
        defaults to the full/display window of the destination image.

      `:filter=` *name*
        Filter name. The default is `blackman-harris` when increasing
        resolution, `lanczos3` when decreasing resolution.

      `:highlightcomp=` *val*
        If nonzero, does highlight compensation by surrounding the filtered
        operation with the equivalent of `--rangecompress` and
        `--rangeexpand`, which can reduce visible ringing artifacts when a
        filter with negative lobes is used on a very high-contrast HDR image.

      `:edgeclamp=` *bool*
        If nonzero, clamp the image to the edge pixels before filtering.
        This might help with certain edge ringing situations. The default is
        0 (off).

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples (suppose that the original image is 640x480)::
    
        --resize 1024x768         # new resolution w=1024, h=768
        --resize 50%              # reduce resolution to 320x240
        --resize 300%             # increase resolution to 1920x1440
        --resize 400x0            # new resolution will be 400x300

        # Create a 1024x768 image that is a resized and shifted version
        # of the original, where the upper left 100x100 section of the
        # original maps to a 200x200 region starting at the 50,50
        # coordinates of the new image.
        --resize:from=100x100:to=200x200+50+50 1024x768

       # Resize to 320x240, but with an additional 1/2 pixel shift in
       # each direction.
       --resize:offset=+0.5+0.5 320x240

.. option:: --fit <size>

    Replace the current image with a new image that is resized to fit
    into the given pixel data resolution, keeping the original aspect ratio
    and padding with black pixels if the requested image size does not
    have the same aspect ratio.  The *size* is in the form

            *width* x *height*

            *width* x *height* [+-] *xoffset* [+-] *yoffset*

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `filter=` *name* : Filter name. The default is `blackman-harris` when
      increasing resolution, `lanczos3` when decreasing resolution.
    - `highlightcomp=` *val* : If nonzero, does highlight compensation by
      surrounding the filtered operation with the equivalent of
      `--rangecompress` and `--rangeexpand`, which can reduce visible ringing
      artifacts when a filter with negative lobes is used on a very
      high-contrast HDR image.
    - `fillmode=` *mode* : determines which of several methods will be used
      to determine how the image will fill the new frame, if its aspect
      ratio does not precisely match the original source aspect ratio:

      - "width" exactly fills the width of the new frame, either cropping
        or letterboxing the height if it isn't precisely the right size to
        preserve the original aspect ratio.
      - "height" exactly fills the height of the new frame, either cropping
        or letterboxing the width if it isn't precisely the right size to
        preserve the original aspect ratio.
      - "letterbox" (the default) chooses whichever of "width" or "height"
        will maximally fill the new frame with no image data lost (it will
        only letterbox, never crop).

    - `pad=` *p* : If the argument is nonzero, will pad with black pixels to
      make the resulting image exactly the size specified, if the source and
      desired size are not the same aspect ratio.
    - `exact=` *e* : If the argument is nonzero, will result in an exact
      match on aspect ratio and centering (partial pixel shift if
      necessary), whereas the default (0) will only preserve aspect ratio
      and centering to the precision of a whole pixel.
    - `wrap=` *wrapmode* : For "exact" aspect ratio fitting, this determines
      the wrap mode used for the resizing kernel (default: `black`, other
      choices include `clamp`, `periodic`, `mirror`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool in.exr --fit:pad=1:exact=1 640x480 -o out.exr

        oiiotool in.exr --fit 1024x1024 -o out.exr

    "height", (d) "letterbox".


.. option:: --pixelaspect <aspect>

    Replace the current image with a new image that scales up the width or
    height in order to match the requested pixel aspect ratio.  If displayed
    in a manner that honors the PixelAspectRatio, it should look the same,
    but it will have different pixel dimensions than the original. It will
    always be the same or higher resolution, so it does not lose any detail
    present in the original.
    
    As an example, if you have a 512x512 image with pixel aspect ratio 1.0,
    `--pixelaspect 2.0` will result in a 512x1024 image that has
    "PixelAspectRatio" metadata set to 2.0.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      - `:filter=` *name* : Filter name. The default is `lanczos3`.

      - `:highlightcomp=` *val* : If nonzero, does highlight compensation by
        surrounding the filtered operation with the equivalent of
        `--rangecompress` and `--rangeexpand`, which can reduce visible
        ringing artifacts when a filter with negative lobes is used on a very
        high-contrast HDR image.

    Examples::

        oiiotool mandrill.tif --pixelaspect 2.0 -o widepixels.tif
    

.. option:: --rotate <angle>

    Replace the current image with a new image that is rotated by the given
    angle (in degrees). Positive angles mean to rotate counter-clockwise,
    negative angles mean clockwise. By default, the center of rotation is at
    the exact center of the display window (a.k.a. "full" image), but can be
    explicitly set with the optional `center=x,y` option.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:center=` *x,y*
        Alternate center of rotation.

      `:filter=` *name*
        Filter name. The default is `lanczos3`.

      `:highlightcomp=` *val*
        If nonzero, does highlight compensation by surrounding the filtered
        operation with the equivalent of `--rangecompress` and
        `--rangeexpand`, which can reduce visible ringing artifacts when a
        filter with negative lobes is used on a very high-contrast HDR image.

      `:recompute_roi=` *val*
        If nonzero, recompute the pixel data window to exactly hold the
        transformed image (default=0).

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool mandrill.tif --rotate 45 -o rotated.tif
    
        oiiotool mandrill.tif --rotate:center=80,91.5:filter=lanczos3 45 -o rotated.tif

       :width: 2.0 in


.. option:: --warp <M33>

    Replace the current image with a new image that is warped by the given
    3x3 matrix (presented as a comma-separated list of values, without
    any spaces).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:filter=` *name*
        Filter name. The default is `lanczos3`.

      `:highlightcomp=` *val*
        If nonzero, does highlight compensation by surrounding the filtered
        operation with the equivalent of `--rangecompress` and
        `--rangeexpand`, which can reduce visible ringing artifacts when a
        filter with negative lobes is used on a very high-contrast HDR image.

      `:recompute_roi=` *val*
        If nonzero, recompute the pixel data window to exactly hold the
        transformed image (default=0).

      `:wrap=` *wrapmode*
        The wrap mode to use when sampling the image for the warp. The default
        is `black`; other choices include `clamp`, `periodic`, `mirror`.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool mandrill.tif --warp "0.707,0.707,0,-0.707,0.707,0,128,-53.02,1" -o warped.tif


.. option:: --st_warp

    Use the top image as a set of normalized `st` image coordinates to warp the
    second image in the stack.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `filter=` *name*
        Filter name. The default is `lanczos3`.

      `chan_s=` *index*
        The index of the `s` channel in the `st` image (default=0).

      `chan_t=` *index*
        The index of the `t` channel in the `st` image (default=1).

      `flip_s=` *bool*
        If nonzero, mirror the `s` coordinates along the horizontal axis. Useful
        for coordinates authored in terms of an origin other than the upper-left
        corner (default=0).

      `flip_t=` *bool*
        If nonzero, mirror the `t` coordinates along the vertical axis. Useful
        for coordinates authored in terms of an origin other than the upper-left
        corner (default=0).

    Examples::

        oiiotool mandrill.tif distortion_st.tif --st_warp -o mandrill_distorted.tif

        # Using an `st` map authored in terms of a lower-left origin (e.g. by
        # Nuke), so flip the vertical (`t`) coordinate.
        oiiotool mandrill.tif st_from_nuke.tif --st_warp:filter=triangle:flip_t=1 -o mandrill_distorted.tif


.. option:: --convolve

    Use the top image as a kernel to convolve the next image farther down
    the stack, replacing both with the result.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        # Use a kernel image already prepared
        oiiotool image.exr kernel.exr --convolve -o output.exr
    
        # Construct a kernel image on the fly with --kernel
        oiiotool image.exr --kernel gaussian 5x5 --convolve -o blurred.exr


.. option:: --blur <size>

    Blur the top image with a blur kernel of the given size expressed as *width*
    x *height*.  (The sizes may be floating point numbers.)

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `kernel=` *name*
        Kernel name. The default is `gaussian`.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool image.jpg --blur 5x5 -o blurred.jpg
    
        oiiotool image.jpg --blur:kernel=bspline 7x7 -o blurred.jpg

.. option:: --median <size>

    Perform a median filter on the top image with a window of the given size
    expressed as *width* x *height*.  (The sizes are integers.) This helps
    to eliminate noise and other unwanted high-frequency detail, but without
    blurring long edges the way a `--blur` command would.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --dilate <size>
            --erode <size>

    Perform dilation or erosion on the top image with a window of the given
    size expressed as *width* x *height*. (The sizes are integers.) Dilation
    takes the maximum of pixel values inside the window, and makes bright
    features wider and more prominent, dark features thinner, and removes
    small isolated dark spots. Erosion takes the minimum of pixel values
    inside the window, and makes dark features wider, bright features
    thinner, and removes small isolated bright spots.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --unsharp

    Unblur the top image using an "unsharp mask.""

    Optional appended modifiers include:
    
      `kernel=` *name*
        Name of the blur kernel (default: `gaussian`). If the kernel name is
        `median`, the unsarp mask algorithm will use a median filter rather
        than a blurring filter in order to compute the low-frequency image.
      `width=` *w*
        Width of the blur kernel (default: 3).
      `contrast=` *c*
        Contrast scale (default: 1.0)
      `threshold=` *t*
        Threshold for applying the difference (default: 0)
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool image.jpg --unsharp -o sharper.jpg
    
        oiiotool image.jpg --unsharp:width=5:contrast=1.5 -o sharper.jpg
    
        oiiotool image.jpg --unsharp:kernel=median -o sharper.jpg
        # Note: median filter helps emphasize compact high-frequency details
        # without over-sharpening long edges as the default unsharp filter
        # sometimes does.



.. option:: --fft
            --ifft

    Performs forward and inverse unitized discrete Fourier transform. The
    forward FFT always transforms only the first channel of the top image on
    the stack, and results in a 2-channel image (with real and imaginary
    channels).  The inverse FFT transforms the first two channels of the top
    image on the stack (assuming they are real and imaginary, respectively)
    and results in a single channel result (with the real component only of
    the spatial domain result).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        # Select the blue channel and take its DCT
        oiiotool image.jpg --ch 2 --fft -o fft.exr
    
        # Reconstruct from the FFT
        oiiotool fft.exr --ifft -o reconstructed.exr
    
        # Output the power spectrum: real^2 + imag^2
        oiiotool fft.exr --dup --mul --chsum -o powerspectrum.exr



.. option:: --polar
            --unpolar

    The `--polar` transforms a 2-channel image whose channels are interpreted
    as complex values (real and imaginary components) into the equivalent
    values expressed in polar form of amplitude and phase (with phase
    between 0 and :math:`2\pi`).
    
    The `unpolar` performs the reverse transformation, converting from polar
    values (amplitude and phase) to complex (real and imaginary).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool complex.exr --polar -o polar.exr
        oiiotool polar.exr --unpolar -o complex.exr



.. option:: --fixnan <streategy>

    Replace the top image with a copy in which any pixels that contained
    `NaN` or `Inf` values (hereafter referred to collectively as
    "nonfinite") are repaired.  If *strategy* is `black`, nonfinite values
    will be replaced with 0.  If *strategy* is `box3`, nonfinite values will
    be replaced by the average of all the finite values within a 3x3 region
    surrounding the pixel. If *strategy* is `error`, nonfinite values will
    be left alone, but it will result in an error that will terminate
    :program:`oiiotool`.


.. option:: --max
            --maxc <value>
            --maxc <value0,value1,value2...>
            --min
            --minc <value>
            --minc <value0,value1,value2...>

    Replace the *two* top images with a new image that is the pixel-by-pixel
    maximum of those images (`--max`) or minimum (`--min`) of the
    corresponding pixels of each image, or the min/max of each pixel of one
    image with a constant color (`--maxc`, `--minc`).

    For `--maxc` and `--minc`, if a single constant value is given, it will
    be used for all color channels. Alternatively, a series of
    comma-separated constant values (with no spaces) may be used to specify
    a different value to add to each channel in the image.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples:

        oiiotool imageA.tif imageB.tif --min -o minimum.tif

        # Clamp all channels to a minimum of 0 (all negative values are
        # changed to 0).
        oiiotool input.exr --minc 0.0 -o nonegatives.exr


.. option:: --clamp

    Replace the top image with a copy in which pixel values have been
    clamped.  Optional arguments include:

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `min=` *val* : Specify a minimum value for all channels.
    - `min=` *val0,val1,...* : Specify minimum value for each channel
      individually.
    - `max=` *val* : Specify a maximum value for all channels.
    - `max=` *val0,val1,...* : Specify maximum value for each channel
      individually.
    - `clampalpha=` *val* : If *val* is nonzero, will additionally clamp the
      alpha channel to [0,1].  (Default: 0, no additional alpha clamp.)
    
    If no value is given for either the minimum or maximum, it will NOT
    clamp in that direction.  For the variety of minimum and maximum that
    specify per-channel values, a missing value indicates that the
    corresponding channel should not be clamped.
    
    Examples:
    
    - `--clamp:min=0` : Clamp all channels to a minimum of 0 (all negative
      values are changed to 0).
    - `--clamp:min=0:max=1` : Clamp all channels to [0,1].
    - `--clamp:clampalpha=1` : Clamp the designated alpha channel to [0,1].
    - `--clamp:min=,,0:max=,,3.0` : Clamp the third channel to [0,3], do not
      clamp & other channels.


.. option:: --maxchan
            --minchan

    Replace the top image with a single channel image that, for each pixel,
    contains the maximum value (for `--maxchan`) or minimum value (for
    `--minchan`) of all the channels in the corresponding pixel of the
    original image.

    This command was first added to OpenImageIO 2.4.0.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples:

        oiiotool RGB.tif --maxchan -o max_of_RGB.tif



.. option:: --rangecompress
            --rangeexpand

    Range compression re-maps input values to a logarithmic scale.
    Range expansion is the inverse mapping back to a linear scale.
    Range compression and expansion only applies to color
    channels; alpha or z channels will not be modified.
    
    By default, this transformation will happen to each color channel
    independently.  But if the optional `luma` argument is nonzero and the
    image has at least 3 channels and the first three channels are not alpha
    or depth, they will be assumed to be RGB and the pixel scaling will be
    done using the luminance and applied equally to all color channels. This
    can help to preserve color even when remapping intensity.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `luma=` *val*
        *val* is 0, turns off the luma behavior.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Range compression and expansion can be useful in cases where high
    contrast super-white (> 1) pixels (such as very bright highlights in HDR
    captured or rendered images) can produce undesirable artifacts, such as
    if you resize an HDR image using a filter with negative lobes -- which
    could result in objectionable ringing or even negative result pixel
    values.  For example::
    
        oiiotool hdr.exr --rangecompress --resize 512x512 --rangeexpand -o resized.exr

.. option:: --fillholes

    Replace the top image with a copy in which any pixels that had
    :math:`\alpha < 1` are "filled" in a smooth way using data from
    surrounding :math:`\alpha > 0` pixels, resulting in an image that is
    :math:`\alpha = 1` and plausible color everywhere. This can be used both
    to fill internal "holes" as well as to extend an image out.


.. option:: --box <x1,y1,x2,y2>

    Draw (rasterize) a filled or unfilled a box with opposite corners
    `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)`. Additional optional arguments include:
    
      `color=` *r,g,b,...*
        specify the color of the lines
      `fill=` *bool*
        if nonzero, fill in the box
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    The default color, if not supplied, is opaque white.

    Examples::

        oiiotool checker.exr --box:color=0,1,1,1 150,100,240,180 \
                     --box:color=0.5,0.5,0,0.5:fill=1 100,50,180,140 -o out.exr
    
    .. image:: figures/box.png
        :align: center
        :width: 2.0 in


.. option:: --line <x1,y1,x2,y2,...>

    Draw (rasterize) an open polyline connecting the list of pixel
    positions, as a comma-separated list of alternating *x* and *y* values.
    Additional optional arguments include:

      `color=` *r,g,b,...*
        specify the color of the line
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    The default color, if not supplied, is opaque white.

    Examples::

    list of alternating *x* and *y* values. Additional optional arguments
    include:

      `color=` *r,g,b,...*
        specify the color of the line
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    The default color, if not supplied, is opaque white.

    Examples::

        oiiotool checker.exr --point:color=1,0,0 10,60,250,20,100,190 -o out.exr

  .. image:: figures/points.png
    :align: center
    :width: 2.0 in


.. option:: --fill <size>

    Alter the top image by filling the ROI specified by *size*. The fill can
    be a constant color, vertical gradient, horizontal gradient, or
    four-corner gradient.
    
    Optional modifiers for constant color:

       `color=` *r,g,b,...*
         the color of the constant
    
    Optional modifiers for vertical gradient:

         the color for the bottom edge of the region
    
    Optional modifiers for horizontal gradient:

        *x* position (in pixel coordinates) of the text
      `y=` *ypos*
        *y* position (in pixel coordinates) of the text
      `size=` *size*
        font size (height, in pixels)
      `font=` *name*
        font name, full path to the font file on disk (use double quotes
        `"name"` if the path name includes spaces or a colon)
      `color=` *r,g,b,...*
        specify the color of the text
      `xalign=` *val*

        if nonzero, will make a dark shadow halo to make the text more clear
        on bright backgrounds.
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    The default positions the text starting at the center of the image,
    drawn 16 pixels high in opaque white in all channels (1,1,1,...), and
    using a default font (which may be system dependent).
    
    Examples::
    
        oiiotool --create 320x240 3 --text:x=10:y=400:size=40 "Hello world" \
            --text:x=100:y=200:font="Arial Bold":color=1,0,0:size=60 "Go Big Red!" \

    Note that because of slightly differing fonts and versions of Freetype
    available, we do not expect drawn text to be pixel-for-pixel identical
    on different platforms supported by OpenImageIO.



:program:`oiiotool` commands for color management
=================================================

Many of the color management commands depend on an installation of
OpenColorIO (http://opencolorio.org).

If OIIO has been compiled with OpenColorIO support and the environment
variable `$OCIO` is set to point to a valid OpenColorIO configuration file,
you will have access to all the color spaces that are known by that OCIO
configuration.  Alternately, you can use the `--colorconfig` option to
explicitly point to a configuration file. If no  valid configuration file is
found (either in `$OCIO` or specified by `--colorconfig}` or OIIO was not
compiled with OCIO support, then the only color space transformats available
are `linear` to `Rec709` (and vice versa) and `linear` to `sRGB` (and vice
versa).

If you ask for :program:`oiiotool` help (`oiiotool --help`), at the very
bottom you will see the list of all color spaces, looks, and displays that
:program:`oiiotool` knows about. That information (including even more detail)
will be printed with the command `oiiotool --colorconfiginfo`.

.. option:: --colorconfiginfo

    Print to the console extensive information about the color management
    configuration, including the list of all known color spaces (and their
    aliases), looks, displays (and their views), as well as which version
    of OpenColorIO is being used, and the path to the configuration file.

    This command was added in OIIO 2.4.6.

.. option:: --colorconfig <filename>

    Instruct :program:`oiiotool` to read an OCIO configuration from a custom
    location. Without this, the default is to use the `$OCIO` environment
    variable as a guide for the location of the configuration file.

.. option:: --iscolorspace <colorspace>

    Alter the metadata of the current image so that it thinks its pixels are
    in the named color space.  This does not alter the pixels of the image,
    it only changes :program:`oiiotool`'s understanding of what color space
    those those pixels are in.

.. option:: --colorconvert <fromspace> <tospace>

    Replace the current image with a new image whose pixels are transformed
    from the named *fromspace* color space into the named *tospace*
    (disregarding any notion it may have previously had about the color
    space of the current image). Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `key=` *name*, `value=` *str* :

      Adds a key/value pair to the "context" that OpenColorIO will used
      when applying the look. Multiple key/value pairs may be specified by
      making each one a comma-separated list.

    - `unpremult=` *val* :

      If the numeric *val* is nonzero, the pixel values will be
      "un-premultipled" (divided by alpha) prior to the actual color
      conversion, and then re-multipled by alpha afterwards. The default is
      0, meaning the color transformation not will be automatically
      bracketed by divide-by-alpha / mult-by-alpha operations.

    - `strict=` *val* :

      When nonzero (the default), an inability to perform the color
      transform will be a hard error. If strict is 0, inability to find the
      transformation will just print a warning and simply copy the image
      without changing colors.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --tocolorspace <tospace>

    Replace the current image with a new image whose pixels are transformed
    from their existing color space (as best understood or guessed by OIIO)
    into the named *tospace*.  This is equivalent to a use of
    `oiiotool --colorconvert` where the *fromspace* is automatically deduced.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --ccmatrix <m00,m01,...>

    **NEW 2.1**

    Replace the current image with a new image whose colors are transformed
    according to the 3x3 or 4x4 matrix formed from the 9 or 16
    comma-separated floating-point values in the subsequent argument (spaces
    are allowed only if the whole collection of values is enclosed in quotes
    so that they are a single command-line argument).
    
    The values fill in the matrix left to right, first row, then second row,
    etc. This means that colors are treated as "row vectors" that are
    post-multiplied by the matrix (`C*M`).

    Optional appended modifiers include:

    - `unpremult=` *val* :

      If the numeric *val* is nonzero, the pixel values will be
      "un-premultipled" (divided by alpha) prior to the actual color
      conversion, and then re-multipled by alpha afterwards. The default is
      0, meaning the color transformation not will be automatically
      bracketed by divide-by-alpha / mult-by-alpha operations.

    - `invert=` *val* :

      If nonzero, this will cause the matrix to be inverted before being
      applied.

    - `transpose=` *val* :

      If nonzero, this will cause the matrix to be transposed (this allowing
      you to more easily specify it as if the color values were column
      vectors and the transformation as `M*C`).

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Example::

      # Convert ACES to ACEScg using a matrix
      oiiotool aces.exr --ccmatrix:transpose=1 \
          "1.454,-0.237,-0.215,-0.077,1.176,-0.010,0.008,-0.006, 0.998" \
          -o acescg.exr

.. option:: --ociolook <lookname>

    Replace the current image with a new image whose pixels are transformed
    using the named OpenColorIO look description.  Optional appended
    arguments include:

    - `from=` *val*

      Assume the image is in the named color space. If no `from=` is
      supplied, it will try to deduce it from the image's metadata or
      previous `--iscolorspace` directives. If no such hints are available,
      it will assume the pixel data are in the default linear scene-referred
      color space.

    - `to=` *val*

      Convert to the named space after applying the look.

    - `inverse=` *val*

      If *val* is nonzero, inverts the color transformation and look
      application.

    - `key=` *name*, `value=` *str*

      Adds a key/value pair to the "context" that OpenColorIO will used
      when applying the look. Multiple key/value pairs may be specified by
      making each one a comma-separated list.

    - `unpremult=` *val* :
    
      If the numeric *val* is nonzero, the pixel values will be
      "un-premultipled" (divided by alpha) prior to the actual color
      conversion, and then re-multipled by alpha afterwards. The default is
      0, meaning the color transformation not will be automatically
      bracketed by divide-by-alpha / mult-by-alpha operations.
    
      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    This command is only meaningful if OIIO was compiled with OCIO support
    and the environment variable `$OCIO` is set to point to a valid
    OpenColorIO configuration file.  If you ask for :program:`oiiotool` help
    (`oiiotool --help`), at the very bottom you will see the list of all
    looks that :program:`oiiotool` knows about.

    Examples::

      oiiotool in.jpg --ociolook:from=vd8:to=vd8:key=SHOT:value=pe0012 match -o cc.jpg



.. option:: --ociodisplay <displayname> <viewname>

    Replace the current image with a new image whose pixels are transformed
    using the named OpenColorIO "display" transformation given by the
    *displayname* and *viewname*.  The word `"default"` (or the empty string
    `""`) for *displayname* means to use the default display, and `"default"`
    or `""` for *viewname* means to use the default view on that display.

    Optional appended modifiers include:
    
      `from=` *val*
        Assume the image is in the named color space. If no `from=` is
        supplied, it will try to deduce it from the image's metadata or
        previous `--iscolorspace` directives. If no such hints are
        available, it will assume the pixel data are in the default linear
        scene-referred color space.
    
      `key=` *name*, `value=` *str*
        Adds a key/value pair to the "context" that OpenColorIO will used
        when applying the look. Multiple key/value pairs may be specified by
        making each one a comma-separated list.
    
      `unpremult=` *val* :
        If the numeric *val* is nonzero, the pixel values will be
        "un-premultipled" (divided by alpha) prior to the actual color
        conversion, and then re-multipled by alpha afterwards. The default
        is 0, meaning the color transformation not will be automatically
        bracketed by divide-by-alpha / mult-by-alpha operations.
    
      `inverse=` *val* :

        If *val* is nonzero, inverts the color transformation.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    This command is only meaningful if OIIO was compiled with OCIO support
    and the environment variable `$OCIO` is set to point to a valid
    OpenColorIO configuration file.  If you ask for :program:`oiiotool` help
    (`oiiotool --help`), at the very bottom you will see the list of all
    looks that :program:`oiiotool` knows about.

    Examples::

        oiiotool in.exr --ociodisplay:from=lnf:key=SHOT:value=pe0012 sRGB Film -o cc.jpg


.. option:: --ociofiletransform <name>

    Replace the current image with a new image whose pixels are transformed
    using the named OpenColorIO file transform.  Optional appended arguments
    include:

    - `inverse=` *val* :

      If *val* is nonzero, inverts the color transformation.

    - `unpremult=` *val* :

      If the numeric *val* is nonzero, the pixel values will be
      "un-premultipled" (divided by alpha) prior to the actual color
      conversion, and then re-multipled by alpha afterwards. The default is
      0, meaning the color transformation not will be automatically
      bracketed by divide-by-alpha / mult-by-alpha operations.

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

    Examples::

        oiiotool in.jpg --ociofiletransform footransform.csp -o out.jpg

.. option:: --unpremult

    Divide all color channels (those not alpha or z) of the current image by
    the alpha value, to "un-premultiply" them.  This presumes that the image
    starts of as "associated alpha," a.k.a. "premultipled." Pixels in which
    the alpha channel is 0 will not be modified (since the operation is
    undefined in that case).  This is a no-op if there is no identified
    alpha channel.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --premult

    Multiply all color channels (those not alpha or z) of the current image
    by the alpha value, to "premultiply'' them.  This presumes that the
    image starts of as "unassociated alpha,'' a.k.a. "non-premultipled."

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).


.. option:: --iccread <filename>

    The `--iccread` command adds an `"ICCProfile"` attribute to the top image,
    as a byte array consisting of the entire contents of the named file.

    This was added to OpenImageIO 2.5.

.. option:: --iccwrite <filename>

    Extract the `"ICCProfile"` attribute from the top image and writing it to
    the named file.

    This was added to OpenImageIO 2.5.

:program:`oiiotool` commands for deep images
============================================

A number of :program:`oiiotool` operations are designed to work with "deep"
images. These are detailed below. In general, operations not listed in this
section should not be expected to work with deep images.

Commands specific to deep images
--------------------------------

.. option:: --deepen

    If the top image is not deep, then turn it into the equivalent "deep"
    image. Pixels with non-infinite $z$ or with any non-zero color channels
    will get a single depth sample in the resulting deep image. Pixels in
    the source that have 0 in all channels, and either no "Z" channel or a
    $z$ value indicating an infinite distance, will result in a pixel with
    no depth samples.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `z=` *val*
        The depth to use for deep samples if the source image did not have a
        "Z" channel. (The default is 1.0.)

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --flatten

    If the top image is "deep," then "flatten" it by compositing the depth
    samples in each pixel.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --deepmerge

    Replace the *two* top images with a new deep image that is the "deep
    merge" of the inputs. Both input images must be deep images, have the
    same number and order of channels and must contain an alpha channel and
    depth channel.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

.. option:: --deepholdout

    Replace the *two* top images with a new deep image that is the ``deep
    holdout'' of the first image by the second --- that is, the samples from
    the first image that are closer than the opaque frontier of the second
    image. Both input inputs must be deep images.

    Optional appended modifiers include:

      `:subimages=` *indices-or-names*
        Include/exclude subimages (see :ref:`sec-oiiotool-subimage-modifier`).

General commands that also work for deep images
-----------------------------------------------


.. option:: --addc, --subc, --mulc, --divc

    Adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing a per-channel constant
    will work for deep images, performing the operation for every sample in
    the image.

.. option:: --autotrim

    For subsequent outputs, automatically `--trim` before writing the file.

.. option:: --ch <channellist>

    Reorder, rename, remove, or add channels to a deep image.
    See Section :ref:`sec-oiiotool-shuffle-channels-or-subimages`


.. option:: --crop <size>

    Crop (adjust the pixel data window), removing pixels or adding empty
    pixels as needed.

.. option:: --paste <position>

    Replace one image's pixels with another's (at an arbitrary offset).

    (This functionality was extended to deep images in OIIO 2.1.)

.. option:: --resample <size>

    Resampling (resize without filtering or interpolation, just choosing the
    closest deep pixel to copy for each output pixel).

    Optional appended modifiers include:
    
    - `interp=` *val* :  If 0, the "closest" single pixel will be copied
      for each sample. If 1, the nearest 4 pixels will be interpolated to
      produce each sample. (Default: 1)

.. option:: --diff

    Report on the difference of the top two images.

.. option:: --dumpdata

    Print to the console detailed information about the values in every pixel.

    Optional appended modifiers include:
    
    - `empty=` *val* :  If 0, will cause deep images to skip printing of
      information about pixels with no samples, and cause non-deep images to
      skip printing information about pixels that are entirely 0.0 value in
      all channels.

.. option:: --info

    Prints information about each input image as it is read.

.. option:: --trim

    Replace the current image with a new image that is cropped to contain
    the minimal rectangular ROI that contains all of the non-empty pixels of
    the original image.

.. option:: --scanline
            --tile <x> <y>

    Convert to scanline or to tiled representations upon output.

.. option:: --stats

    Prints detailed statistical information about each input image as it is
    read.

.. option:: --fixnan <streategy>

    Replace the top image with a copy in which any pixels that contained
    `NaN` or `Inf` values (hereafter referred to collectively as
    "nonfinite") are repaired.  The *strategy* may be either `black` or
    `error`.
