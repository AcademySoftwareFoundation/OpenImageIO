Metadata conventions
####################



The ImageSpec class, described thoroughly in :ref:`sec-ImageSpec`, provides
the basic description of an image that are essential across all formats ---
resolution, number of channels, pixel data format, etc.  Individual images
may have additional data, stored as name/value pairs in the `extra_attribs`
field. Though literally *anything* can be stored in `extra_attribs` --- it's
specifically designed for format- and user-extensibility --- this chapter
establishes some guidelines and lays out all of the field names that
OpenImageIO understands.


Description of the image
========================

.. option:: "ImageDescription" : string

    The image description, title, caption, or comments.

.. option:: "Keywords" : string

    Semicolon-separated keywords describing the contents of the image.
    (Semicolons are used rather than commas because of the common case of a
    comma being part of a keyword itself, e.g., "Kurt Vonnegut, Jr." or
    "Washington, DC."")

.. option:: "Artist" : string

    The artist, creator, or owner of the image.

.. option:: "Copyright" : string

    Any copyright notice or owner of the image.

.. option:: "DateTime" : string

    The creation date of the image, in the following format: `YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS` (exactly 19 characters long, not including a terminating
    NULL).  For example, 7:30am on Dec 31, 2008 is encoded as
    `"2008:12:31 07:30:00"`.

    Usually this is simply the time that the image data was last modified.
    It may be wise to also store the `"Exif:DateTimeOriginal"` and
    `"Exif:DateTimeDigitized"` (see Section :ref:`sec-metadata-exif`) to
    further distinguish the original image and its conversion to digital
    media.

.. option:: "DocumentName" : string

    The name of an overall document that this image is a part of.

.. option:: "Software" : string

    The software that was used to create the image.

.. option:: "HostComputer" : string

    The name or identity of the computer that created the image.



.. _sec-metadata-displayhints:
.. _sec-metadata-orientation:

Display hints
=============


.. option:: "Orientation" : int

    y default, image pixels are ordered from the top of the display to the
    ottom, and within each scanline, from left to right (i.e., the same
    rdering as English text and scan progression on a CRT).  But the
    "Orientation"` field can suggest that it should be displayed with
    different orientation, according to the TIFF/EXIF conventions:

    ===  ==========================================================================
     0   normal (top to bottom, left to right)
     1   flipped horizontally (top to botom, right to left)
     2   rotated :math:`180^\circ` (bottom to top, right to left)
     3   flipped vertically (bottom to top, left to right)
     4   transposed (left to right, top to bottom)
     5   rotated :math:`90^\circ` clockwise (right to left, top to bottom)
     6   transverse (right to left, bottom to top)
     7   rotated :math:`90^\circ` counter-clockwise (left to right, bottom to top)
    ===  ==========================================================================

.. option:: "PixelAspectRatio" : float

    The aspect ratio (:math:`x/y`) of the size of individual pixels, with
    square pixels being 1.0 (the default).

.. option:: "XResolution" : float
            "YResolution" : float
            "ResolutionUnit" : string

    The number of horizontal (*x*) and vertical (*y*) pixels per resolution
    unit.  This ties the image to a physical size (where applicable, such as
    with a scanned image, or an image that will eventually be printed).

    Different file formats may dictate different resolution units. For
    example, the TIFF ImageIO plugin supports `none`, `in`, and `cm`.

.. option:: "oiio:Movie" : int

    If nonzero, a hint that a multi-image file is meant to be interpreted as
    an animation (i.e., that the subimages are a time sequence).

.. option:: "oiio:subimages" : int

    If nonzero, the number of subimages in the file. Not all image file
    formats can know this without reading the entire file, and in such
    cases, this attribute will not be set or will be 0. If the value is
    present and greater than zero, it can be trusted, but if not, nothing
    should be inferred and you will have to repeatedly seek to subimages
    to find out how many there are.

.. option:: "FramesPerSecond" : rational

    For a multi-image file intended to be played back as an animation, the
    frame refresh rate. (It's technically a rational, but it may be
    retrieved as a float also, if you are ok with imprecision.)



.. _sec-metadata-color:

Color information
=================

.. option:: "oiio:ColorSpace" : string

    The name of the color space of the color channels.  Values incude:
    
    - `"Linear"` :  Color pixel values are known to be scene-linear and
      using facility-default color primaries (presumed sRGB/Rec709 color
      primaries if otherwise unknown.
    - `"sRGB"` :  Using standard sRGB response and primaries.
    - `"Rec709"` :  Using standard Rec709 response and primaries.
    - `"ACES"` :  ACES color space encoding.
    - `"AdobeRGB"` :  Adobe RGB color space.
    - `"KodakLog"` :  Kodak logarithmic color space.
    - `"GammaCorrectedX.Y"` :  Color values have been gamma corrected
      (raised to the power :math:`1/\gamma`). The `X.Y` is the numeric value
      of the gamma exponent.
    - *arbitrary* :  The name of any color space known to OpenColorIO (if
      OCIO support is present).

.. option:: "oiio:Gamma" : float

    If the color space is "GammaCorrectedX.Y", this value is the gamma
    exponent. (Optional/deprecated; if present, it should match the suffix
    of the color space.)

.. option:: "oiio:BorderColor" : float[nchannels]

    The color presumed to be filling any parts of the display/full image
    window that are not overlapping the pixel data window.  If not supplied,
    the default is black (0 in all channels).

.. option:: "ICCProfile" : uint8[]

    The ICC color profile takes the form of an array of bytes (unsigned 8
    bit chars). The length of the array is the length of the profile blob.



Disk file format info/hints
===========================

.. option:: "oiio:BitsPerSample" : int

    Number of bits per sample *in the file*.
    
    Note that this may not match the reported `ImageSpec::format`, if the
    plugin is translating from an unsupported format.  For example, if a
    file stores 4 bit grayscale per channel, the `"oiio:BitsPerSample"` may
    be 4 but the `format` field may be `TypeDesc::UINT8` (because the
    OpenImageIO APIs do not support fewer than 8 bits per sample).

.. option:: "oiio:UnassociatedAlpha" : int

    Whether the data in the file stored alpha channels (if any) that were
    unassociated with the color (i.e., color not "premultiplied" by the
    alpha coverage value).

.. option:: "planarconfig" : string

    `contig` indicates that the file has contiguous pixels (RGB RGB RGB...),
    whereas `separate` indicate that the file stores each channel separately
    (RRR...GGG...BBB...).

    Note that only contiguous pixels are transmitted through the OpenImageIO
    APIs, but this metadata indicates how it is (or should be) stored in the
    file, if possible.

.. option:: "compression" : string

    Indicates the type of compression the file uses.  Supported compression
    modes will vary from file format to file format, and each reader/writer
    plugin should document the modes it supports.  If `ImageOutput::open` is
    called with an ImageSpec that specifies an compression mode not
    supported by that ImageOutput, it will choose a reasonable default. As
    an example, the OpenEXR writer supports `none`, `rle`, `zip`, `zips`,
    `piz`, `pxr24`, `b44`, `b44a`, `dwaa`, or `dwab`.

    he compression name is permitted to have a quality value to be appended
    fter a colon, for example `dwaa:60`.  The exact meaning and range of
    he quality value can vary between different file formats and compression
    odes, and some don't support quality values at all (it will be ignored if
    ot supported, or if out of range).

.. option:: "CompressionQuality" : int

    DEPRECATED(2.1)

    This is a deprecated methods of separately specifying the compression
    quality. Indicates the quality of compression to use (0--100), for those
    plugins and compression methods that allow a variable amount of
    compression, with higher numbers indicating higher image fidelity.




Substituting an `IOPRoxy` for custom I/O overrides
======================================================

Format readers and writers that respond positively to `supports("ioproxy")`
have the ability to read or write using an *I/O proxy* object. Among other
things, this lets an ImageOutput write the file to a memory buffer rather
than saving to disk, and for an ImageInput to read the file from a memory
buffer. (Currently, only PNG and OpenEXR have the ability to do this.) This
behavior is controlled by a special attributes

.. option:: "oiio:ioproxy" : pointer

    Pointer to a `Filesystem::IOProxy` that will handle the I/O.

An explanation of how this feature is used may be found in Sections
:ref:`sec-imageinput-readfilefrommemory` and
:ref:`sec-imageoutput-writefiletomemory`.


Photographs or scanned images
=============================

The following metadata items are specific to photos or captured images.

.. option:: "Make" : string

    For captured or scanned image, the make of the camera or scanner.

.. option:: "Model" : string

    For captured or scanned image, the model of the camera or scanner.

.. option:: "ExposureTime" : float

    The exposure time (in seconds) of the captured image.

.. option:: "FNumber" : float

    The f/stop of the camera when it captured the image.



Texture Information
===================

Several standard metadata are very helpful for images that are intended
to be used as textures (especially for OpenImageIO's TextureSystem).

.. option:: "textureformat" : string

    The kind of texture that this image is intended to be.  We suggest the
    following names:

    =====================   ================================================
    Plain Texture           Ordinary 2D texture
    Volume Texture          3D volumetric texture
    Shadow                  Ordinary *z*-depth shadow map
    CubeFace Shadow         Cube-face shadow map
    Volume Shadow           Volumetric ("deep") shadow map
    LatLong Environment     Latitude-longitude (rectangular) environment map
    CubeFace Environment    Cube-face environment map
    =====================   ================================================

.. option:: "wrapmodes" : string

    Give the intended texture *wrap mode* indicating what happens with
    texture coordinates outside the :math:`[0...1]` range.  We suggest the
    following names: `black`, `periodic`, `clamp`, `mirror`. If the wrap
    mode is different in each direction, they should simply be separated by
    a comma.  For example, `black` means black wrap in both directions,
    whereas `clamp,periodic` means to clamp in :math:`u` and be periodic in
    :math:`v`.

.. option:: "fovcot" : float

    The cotangent (:math:`x/y`) of the field of view of the original image
    (which may not be the same as the aspect ratio of the pixels of the
    texture, which may have been resized).

.. option:: "worldtocamera" : matrix44

    For shadow maps or rendered images this item (of type
    `TypeDesc::PT_MATRIX`) is the world-to-camera matrix describing the
    camera position.

.. option:: "worldtoscreen" : matrix44

    For shadow maps or rendered images this item (of type
    `TypeDesc::PT_MATRIX`) is the world-to-screen matrix describing the full
    projection of the 3D view onto a :math:`[-1...1] \times [-1...1]` 2D
    domain.

.. option:: "worldtoNDC" : matrix44

    For shadow maps or rendered images this item (of type
    `TypeDesc::PT_MATRIX`) is the world-to-NDC matrix describing the full
    projection of the 3D view onto a :math:`[0...1] \times [0...1]` 2D
    domain.

.. option:: "oiio:updirection" : string

    For environment maps, indicates which direction is "up" (valid values
    are `y` or `z`), to disambiguate conventions for environment map
    orientation.

.. option:: "oiio:sampleborder" : int

    If not present or 0 (the default), the conversion from pixel integer
    coordinates :math:`(i,j)` to texture coordinates :math:`(s,t)` follows
    the usual convention of :math:`s = (i+0.5)/\mathit{xres}` and
    :math:`t = (j+0.5)/\mathit{yres}`. However, if this attribute is present
    and nonzero, the first and last row/column of pixels lie exactly at the
    :math:`s` or :math:`t = 0` or :math:`1` boundaries, i.e.,
    :math:`s = i/(\mathit{xres}-1)` and :math:`t = j/(\mathit{yres}-1)`.

.. option:: "oiio:ConstantColor" : string

    If present, is a hint that the texture has the same value in all pixels,
    and the metadata value is a string containing the channel values as a
    comma-separated list (no spaces, for example: `0.73,0.9,0.11,1.0`).

.. option:: "oiio:AverageColor" : string

    If present, is a hint giving the *average* value of all pixels in the
    texture, as a string containing a comma-separated list of the channel
    values (no spaces, for example: `0.73,0.9,0.11,1.0`).

.. option:: "oiio:SHA-1" : string

    f present, is a 40-byte SHA-1 hash of the input image (possibly salted
    with arious maketx options) that can serve to quickly compare two
    separate extures to know if they contain the same pixels. While it's
    not, echnically, 100% guaranteed that no separate textures will match,
    it's so stronomically unlikely that we discount the possibility (you'd
    be rendering ovies for centuries before finding a single match).



.. _sec-metadata-exif:

Exif metadata
=============

..
    % FIXME -- unsupported/undocumented: ExifVersion, FlashpixVersion,

IPTC metadata
=============

The IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) publishes
conventions for storing image metadata, and this standard is growing in
popularity and is commonly used in photo-browsing programs to record
captions and keywords.

The following IPTC metadata items correspond exactly to metadata in the
OpenImageIO conventions, so it is recommended that you use the standards and
that plugins supporting IPTC metadata respond likewise:

    ===============  =========================================================================================================
    IPTC tag         OpenImageIO metadata convention
    ===============  =========================================================================================================
    Caption          `"ImageDescription"`
    Keyword          IPTC keywords should be concatenated, separated by semicolons (`;`), and stored as the `Keywords` attribute.
    ExposureTime     `ExposureTime`
    CopyrightNotice  `Copyright`
    Creator          `Artist`
    ===============  =========================================================================================================


The remainder of IPTC metadata fields should use the following names,
prefixed with `IPTC:` to avoid conflicts with other plugins or standards.

.. option:: "IPTC:ObjecTypeReference" : string

    Object type reference.

.. option:: "IPTC:ObjectAttributeReference" : string

    Object attribute reference.

            "IPTC:Country" : string
            "IPTC:CountryCode" : string

    The city, sublocation within the city, state, country, and country code
    of the location of the image.

.. option:: "IPTC:Headline" : string

SMPTE metadata
==============

    `TypeDesc`, it will be tagged with vecsemantics `TIMECODE`).

.. option:: "smpte:KeyCode" : int[7]

    SMPTE key code, encoded as an array of 7 32-bit integers (as a
    `TypeDesc`, it will be tagged with vecsemantics `KEYCODE`).




Extension conventions
=====================

To avoid conflicts with other plugins, or with any additional standard
metadata names that may be added in future verions of OpenImageIO, it is
strongly advised that writers of new plugins should prefix their metadata
with the name of the format, much like the `"Exif:"` and `"IPTC:"` metadata.
