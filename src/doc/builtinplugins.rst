.. _sec-bundledplugins-bmp:

BMP
===============================================

BMP is a bitmap image file format used mostly on Windows systems.
BMP files use the file extension :file:`.bmp`.

BMP is not a nice format for high-quality or high-performance images.
It only supports unsigned integer 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8- bits per channel; only
grayscale, RGB, and RGBA; does not support MIPmaps, multiimage, or
tiles.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-cineon:

Cineon
===============================================

Cineon is an image file format developed by Kodak that is commonly
used for scanned motion picture film and digital intermediates.
Cineon files use the file extension :file:`.cin`.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-dds:

DDS
===============================================

DDS (Direct Draw Surface) is an image file format designed by Microsoft
for use in Direct3D graphics.  DDS files use the extension :file:`.dds`.

DDS is an awful format, with several compression modes that are all so
lossy as to be completely useless for high-end graphics.  Nevertheless,
they are widely used in games and graphics hardware directly supports
these compression modes.  Alas.

OpenImageIO currently only supports reading DDS files, not writing them.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-dpx:

DPX
===============================================

DPX (Digital Picture Exchange) is an image file format used for
motion picture film scanning, output, and digital intermediates.
DPX files use the file extension :file:`.dpx`.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-field3d:

Field3D
===============================================

Field3d is an open-source volume data file format.  Field3d files commonly
use the extension :file:`.f3d`. The official Field3D site is:
https://github.com/imageworks/Field3D Currently, OpenImageIO only reads
Field3d files, and does not write them.

Fields are comprised of multiple *layers* (which appear to OpenImageIO
as subimages).  Each layer/subimage may have a different name, resolution,
and coordinate mapping.  Layers may be scalar (1 channel) or vector (3
channel) fields, and the data may be ``half``, `float`, or ``double``.

OpenImageIO always reports Field3D files as tiled.  If the Field3d file has
a "block size", the block size will be reported as the tile size. Otherwise,
the tile size will be the size of the entire volume.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - Field3d header data or explanation
   * - ``ImageDescription``
     - string
     - unique layer name
   * - ``oiio:subimagename``
     - string
     - unique layer name
   * - ``field3d:partition``
     - string
     - the partition name
   * - ``field3d:layer``
     - string
     - the layer (a.k.a. attribute) name
   * - ``field3d:fieldtype``
     - string
     - field type, one of: ``"dense"``, ``"sparse"``, or ``"MAC"``
   * - ``field3d:mapping``
     - string
     - the coordinate mapping type
   * - ``field3d:localtoworld``
     - matrix of doubles
     - if a matrixMapping, the local-to-world transformation matrix
   * - ``worldtolocal``
     - matrix
     - if a matrixMapping, the world-to-local coordinate mapping


The "unique layer name" is generally the partition name + ``:`` + attribute
name (example: ``"defaultfield:density"``), with the following exceptions:
(1) if the partition and attribute names are identical, just one is used
rather than it being pointlessly concatenated (e.g., ``"density"``, not
``"density:density"``); (2) if there are mutiple partitions + attribute
combinations with identical names in the same file, "*number*" will be added
after the partition name for subsequent layers (e.g., ``"default:density"``,
``"default.2:density"``, ``"default.3:density"``).

.. _sec-bundledplugins-fits:

FITS
===============================================

FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is an image file format used for
scientific applications, particularly professional astronomy. FITS files use
the file extension :file:`.fits`. Official FITS specs and other info may be
found at: http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/

OpenImageIO supports multiple images in FITS files, and supports the
following pixel data types: UINT8, UINT16, UINT32, FLOAT, DOUBLE.

FITS files can store various kinds of arbitrary data arrays, but
OpenImageIO's support of FITS is mostly limited using FITS for image
storage.  Currently, OpenImageIO only supports 2D FITS data (images), not 3D
(volume) data, nor 1-D or higher-dimensional arrays.



.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - FITS header data or explanation
   * - ``Orientation``
     - int
     - derived from FITS "ORIENTAT" field.
   * - ``DateTime``
     - string
     - derived from the FITS "DATE" field.
   * - ``Comment``
     - string
     - FITS "COMMENT" (*)
   * - ``History``
     - string
     - FITS "HISTORY" (*)
   * - ``Hierarch``
     - string
     - FITS "HIERARCH" (*)
   * - *other*
     - 
     - all other FITS keywords will be added to the ImageSpec as arbitrary
       named metadata.

.. note:: If the file contains multiple COMMENT, HISTORY, or HIERARCH
  fields, their text will be appended to form a single attribute (of
  each) in OpenImageIO's ImageSpec.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-gif:

GIF
===============================================

GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is an image file format developed by
CompuServe in 1987.  Nowadays it is widely used to display basic animations
despite its technical limitations.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - GIF header data or explanation
   * - ``gif:Interlacing``
     - int
     - Specifies if image is interlaced (0 or 1).
   * - ``FramesPerSecond``
     - int[2] (rational)
     - Frames per second
   * - ``oiio:Movie``
     - int
     - If nonzero, indicates that it's an animated GIF.
   * - ``gif:LoopCount``
     - int
     - Number of times the animation should be played (0-65535, 0 stands for infinity).
   * - ``ImageDescription``
     - string
     - The GIF comment field.

**Limitations**

* GIF only supports 3-channel (RGB) images and at most 8 bits per channel.
* Each subimage can include its own palette or use global palette. Palettes
  contain up to 256 colors of which one can be used as background color. It
  is then emulated with additional Alpha channel by OpenImageIO's reader.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-hdr:

HDR/RGBE
===============================================

HDR (High Dynamic Range), also known as RGBE (rgb with extended range),
is a simple format developed for the Radiance renderer to store high
dynamic range images.  HDR/RGBE files commonly use the file extensions
:file:`.hdr`.  The format is described in this section of the Radiance
documentation: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf

RGBE does not support tiles, multiple subimages, mipmapping, true half or
float pixel values, or arbitrary metadata.  Only RGB (3 channel) files are
supported.

RGBE became important because it was developed at a time when no standard
file formats supported high dynamic range, and is still used for many legacy
applications and to distribute HDR environment maps. But newer formats with
native HDR support, such as OpenEXR, are vastly superior and should be
preferred except when legacy file access is required.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - RGBE header data or explanation
   * - ``Orientation``
     - int
     - encodes the orientation (see Section :ref:`sec-metadata-orientation`)
   * - ``oiio:ColorSpace``
     - string
     - Color space (see Section :ref:`sec-metadata-color`).
   * - ``oiio:Gamma``
     - float
     - the gamma correction specified in the RGBE header (if it's gamma corrected).



|

.. _sec-bundledplugins-heif:

HEIF/HEIC
===============================================

HEIF is a container format for images compressed with the HEIC compression
standard (same compression as HEVC/H.265). It is used commonly for iPhone
camera pictures, but it is not Apple-specific and will probably become more
popualar on other platforms in coming years. HEIF files usually use the file
extension :file:`.HEIC`.

HEIC compression is lossy, but is higher visual quality than JPEG while
taking only half the file size. Currently, OIIO's HEIF reader supports
reading files as RGB or RGBA, uint8 pixel values. Multi-image files are
currently supported for reading, but not yet writing. All pixel data is
uint8, though we hope to add support for HDR (more than 8 bits) in the
future.

**Configuration settings for HEIF output**

When opening an HEIF ImageOutput, the following special metadata tokens
control aspects of the writing itself:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - HEIF header data or explanation
   * - ``Compression``
     - string
     - If supplied, must be ``"heic"``, but may optionally have a quality
       value appended, like ``"heic:90"``. Quality can be 1-100, with 100
       meaning lossless. The default is 75.



|

.. _sec-bundledplugins-ico:

ICO
===============================================

ICO is an image file format used for small images (usually icons) on
Windows.  ICO files use the file extension :file:`.ico`.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - ICO header data or explanation
   * - ``oiio:BitsPerSample``
     - int
     - the true bits per sample in the ICO file.
   * - ``ico:PNG``
     - int
     - if nonzero, will cause the ICO to be written out using PNG format.

**Limitations**

* ICO only supports UINT8 and UINT16 formats; all output images will
  be silently converted to one of these.
* ICO only supports *small* images, up to 256 x 256.
  Requests to write larger images will fail their ``open()`` call.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-iff:

IFF
===============================================

IFF files are used by Autodesk Maya and use the file extension :file:`.iff`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - IFF header data or explanation

     - string
     - The compression type (``"none"`` or ``"rle"`` [default])
   * - ``oiio:BitsPerSample``
     - int
     - the true bits per sample of the IFF file.



|

.. _sec-bundledplugins-jpeg:

JPEG
===============================================

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), or more properly the JFIF file
format containing JPEG-compressed pixel data, is one of the most popular
file formats on the Internet, with applications, and from digital
cameras, scanners, and other image acquisition devices.  JPEG/JFIF files
usually have the file extension :file:`.jpg`, :file:`.jpe`, :file:`.jpeg`,
:file:`.jif`, :file:`.jfif`, or :file:`.jfi`.  The JFIF file format is
described by http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf.

Although we strive to support JPEG/JFIF because it is so widely used, we
acknowledge that it is a poor format for high-end work: it supports only
1- and 3-channel images, has no support for alpha channels, no support
for high dynamic range or even 16 bit integer pixel data, by convention
stores sRGB data and is ill-suited to linear color spaces, and does not
support multiple subimages or MIPmap levels.  There are newer formats
also blessed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group that attempt to
address some of these issues, such as JPEG-2000, but these do not have
anywhere near the acceptance of the original JPEG/JFIF format.



.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - JPEG header data or explanation
   * - ``ImageDescription``
     - string
     - the JPEG Comment field
   * - ``Orientation``
     - int
     - the image orientation
   * - ``XResolution``, ``YResolution``, ``ResolutionUnit``
     -
     - The resolution and units from the Exif header
   * - ``Compression``
     - string
     - If supplied, must be ``"jpeg"``, but may optionally have a quality
       value appended, like ``"jpeg:90"``. Quality can be 1-100, with 100
       meaning lossless.
   * - ``ICCProfile``
     - uint8[]
     - The ICC color profile
   * - ``jpeg:subsampling``
     - string
     - Describes the chroma subsampling, e.g., ``"4:2:0"`` (the default),
       ``"4:4:4"``, ``"4:2:2"``, ``"4:2:1"``.
   * - ``Exif:*``, ``IPTC:*``, ``XMP:*``, ``GPS:*``
     - 
     - Extensive Exif, IPTC, XMP, and GPS data are supported by the
       reader/writer, and you should assume that nearly everything described
       Appendix :ref:`chap-stdmetadata` is properly translated when using
       JPEG files.


**Limitations**

* JPEG/JFIF only supports 1- (grayscale) and 3-channel (RGB) images. As a
  special case, OpenImageIO's JPEG writer will accept n-channel image
  data, but will only output the first 3 channels (if n >= 3) or the first
  channel (if n <= 2), silently drop any extra channels from the output.
* Since JPEG/JFIF only supports 8 bits per channel, OpenImageIO's
  JPEG/JFIF writer will silently convert to UINT8 upon output,
  regardless of requests to the contrary from the calling program.
* OpenImageIO's JPEG/JFIF reader and writer always operate in scanline
  mode and do not support tiled image input or output.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-jpeg2000:

JPEG-2000
===============================================

JPEG-2000 is a successor to the popular JPEG/JFIF format, that supports
better (wavelet) compression and a number of other extensions.  It's geared
toward photography. JPEG-2000 files use the file extensions :file:`.jp2` or
:file:`.j2k`. The official JPEG-2000 format specification and other helpful
info may be found at: http://www.jpeg.org/JPEG2000.htm

JPEG-2000 is not yet widely used, so OpenImageIO's support of it is
preliminary.  In particular, we are not yet very good at handling the
metadata robustly.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - JPEG-2000 header data or explanation
   * - ``jpeg2000:streamformat``

.. _sec-bundledplugins-ffmpeg:

Movie formats (using ffmpeg)
===============================================

The :program:`ffmpeg`-based reader is capable of reading the individual
frames from a variety of movie file formats, including:


=====================   ====================================================
Format                  Extensions
=====================   ====================================================
AVI                     :file:`.avi`
QuickTime               :file:`.qt`, :file:`.mov`
MPEG-4                  :file:`.mp4`, :file:`.m4a`, :file:`.m4v`
3GPP files              :file:`.3gp`, :file:`.3g2`
Motion JPEG-2000        :file:`.mj2`
Apple M4V               :file:`.m4v`
MPEG-1/MPEG-2           :file:`.mpg`
=====================   ====================================================


Currently, these files may only be read. Write support may be added in a
future release.  Also, currently, these files simply look to OIIO like
simple multi-image files and not much support is given to the fact that they
are technically *movies* (for example, there is no support for reading audio
information).

Some special attributes are used for movie files:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - Header data or explanation
   * - ``oiio:Movie``
     - int
     - Nonzero value for movie files
   * - ``oiio:subimages``
     - int
     - The number of frames in the movie, positive if it can be known
       without reading the entire file. Zero or not present if the number
       of frames cannot be determinend from reading from just the file
       header.
   * - ``FramesPerSecond``
     - int[2] (rational)
     - Frames per second

.. _sec-bundledplugins-null:

Null format
===============================================

The ``nullptr`` reader/writer is a mock-up that does not perform any actual
I/O. The reader just returns constant-colored pixels, and the writer just
returns directly without saving any data. This has several uses:

* Benchmarking, if you want to have OIIO's input or output truly take as
  close to no time whatsoever.

* "Dry run" of applications where you don't want it to produce any real
  output (akin to a Unix command that you redirect output to
  :file:`/dev/null`).

* Make "fake" input that looks like a file, but the file doesn't exist (if
  you are happy with constant-colored pixels).

The filename allows a REST-ful syntax, where you can append modifiers
that specify things like resolution (of the non-existent file), etc.
For example::

    foo.null?RES=640x480&CHANNELS=3

would specify a null file with resolution 640x480 and 3 channels.
Token/value pairs accepted are:

=====================   ====================================================
``RES=1024x1024``       Set resolution (3D example: 256x256x100)
``CHANNELS=4``          Set number of channels
``TILES=64x64``         Makes it look like a tiled image with tile size
``TYPE=uint8``          Set the pixel data type
``PIXEL=r,g,b,...``     Set pixel values (comma separates channel values)
``TEX=1``               Make it look like a full MIP-mapped texture
``attrib=value``        Anything else will set metadata

.. _sec-bundledplugins-openexr:

OpenEXR
===============================================

OpenEXR is an image file format developed by Industrial Light & Magic,
and subsequently open-sourced.  OpenEXR's strengths include support of
high dynamic range imagery (``half`` and `float` pixels), tiled
images, explicit support of MIPmaps and cubic environment maps,
arbitrary metadata, and arbitrary numbers of color channels.  OpenEXR
files use the file extension :file:`.exr`.
The official OpenEXR site is http://www.openexr.com/.

       the writer receives a request for a compression type it does not
       recognize or is not supported by the version of OpenEXR on the
       system, it will use ``"zip"`` by default. For ``"dwaa"`` and
       ``"dwab"``, the dwaCompressionLevel may be optionally appended to the
       compression name after a colon, like this: ``"dwaa:200"``. (The
       default DWA compression value is 45.)
   * - ``textureformat``
     - string
     - ``"Plain Texture"`` for MIP-mapped OpenEXR files, ``"CubeFace
       Environment"`` or ``"Latlong Environment"`` for OpenEXR environment

       apparent type.


**Configuration settings for OpenEXR input**

When opening an OpenEXR ImageInput with a *configuration* (see
Section :ref:`sec-inputwithconfig`), the following special configuration
attributes are supported:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``oiio:ioproxy``
     - ptr
     - Pointer to a ``Filesystem::IOProxy`` that will handle the I/O, for
       example by reading from memory rather than the file system.
   * - ``oiio:missingcolor``
     - float *or* string
     - Either an array of float values or a string holding a comma-separated
       list of values, if present this is a request to use this color for
       pixels of any missing tiles or scanlines, rather than considering a
       tile/scanline read failure to be an error. This can be helpful when
       intentionally reading partially-written or incomplete files (such as
       an in-progress render).

**Configuration settings for OpenEXR output**

When opening an OpenEXR ImageOutput, the following special metadata tokens
control aspects of the writing itself:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Output Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``oiio:RawColor``
     - int
     - If nonzero, writing images with non-RGB color models (such as YCbCr)
       will keep unaltered pixel values (versus the default OIIO behavior
       of automatically converting from RGB to the designated color space
       as the pixels are written).
   * - ``oiio:ioproxy``
     - ptr
     - Pointer to a ``Filesystem::IOProxy`` that will handle the I/O, for
       example by writing to a memory buffer.


**Custom I/O Overrides**

OpenEXR input and output both support the "custom I/O" feature via the
special ``"oiio:ioproxy"`` attributes (see
Sections :ref:`sec-imageoutput-ioproxy` and :ref:`sec-imageinput-ioproxy`).

**A note on channel names**

The underlying OpenEXR library (:file:`libIlmImf`) always saves channels
into lexicographic order, so the channel order on disk (and thus when read!)
will NOT match the order when the image was created.

But in order to adhere to OIIO's convention that RGBAZ will always be the
first channels (if they exist), OIIO's OpenEXR reader will automatically
reorder just those channels to appear at the front and in that order. All
other channel names will remain in their relative order as presented to OIIO
by :file:`libIlmImf`.

**Limitations**

* The OpenEXR format only supports HALF, FLOAT, and UINT32 pixel
  data.  OpenImageIO's OpenEXR writer will silently convert data in formats
  (including the common UINT8 and UINT16 cases) to HALF data for output.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-openvdb:

OpenVDB
===============================================

OpenVDB is an open-source volume data file format.  OpenVDB files commonly
use the extension :file:`.vdb`. The official OpenVDB site is:
http://www.openvdb.org/ Currently, OpenImageIO only reads OpenVDB files, and
does not write them.

Volumes are comprised of multiple *layers* (which appear to OpenImageIO as
subimages).  Each layer/subimage may have a different name, resolution, and
coordinate mapping.  Layers may be scalar (1 channel) or vector (3 channel)
fields, and the voxel data are always `float`. OpenVDB files always
report as tiled, using the leaf dimension size.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type

   * - ``worldtocamera``
     - matrix
     - World-to-local coordinate mapping.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-png:

PNG
===============================================

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an image file format developed by the
open source community as an alternative to the GIF, after Unisys started
enforcing patents allegedly covering techniques necessary to use GIF. PNG
files use the file extension :file:`.png`.

**Attributes**

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute

     - the timestamp in the PNG header
   * - ``PixelAspectRatio``
     - float
     - pixel aspect ratio
   * - ``XResolution``, ``YResolution``, ``ResolutionUnit``
     - 
     - resolution and units from the PNG header.
   * - ``oiio:ColorSpace``
     - string
     - Color space (see Section :ref:`sec-metadata-color`).
   * - ``oiio:Gamma``
     - float
     - the gamma correction value (if specified).
   * - ``ICCProfile``
     - uint8[]
     - The ICC color profile

**Configuration settings for PNG input**

When opening an PNG ImageInput with a *configuration* (see
Section :ref:`sec-inputwithconfig`), the following special configuration
attributes are supported:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``oiio:UnassociatedAlpha``
     - int
     - If nonzero, will leave alpha unassociated (versus the default of
       premultiplying color channels by alpha if the alpha channel is
       unassociated).
   * - ``oiio:ioproxy``
     - ptr
     - Pointer to a ``Filesystem::IOProxy`` that will handle the I/O, for
       example by reading from memory rather than the file system.

**Configuration settings for PNG output**

When opening an PNG ImageOutput, the following special metadata tokens
control aspects of the writing itself:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Output Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``png:compressionLevel``
     - int
     - Compression level for zip/deflate compression, on a scale from 0
       (fastest, minimal compression) to 9 (slowest, maximal compression).
       The default is 6. PNG compression is always lossless.
   * - ``png:filter``
     - int
     - Controls the "row filters" that prepare the image for optimal
       compression. The default is 0 (``PNG_NO_FILTERS``), but other values
       (which may be "or-ed" or summed to combine their effects) are 8
       (``PNG_FILTER_NONE``), 16 (``PNG_FILTER_SUB``), 32
       (``PNG_FILTER_UP``), 64 (``PNG_FILTER_AVG``), or 128
       (``PNG_FILTER_PAETH``).
   * - ``oiio:ioproxy``
     - ptr
     - Pointer to a ``Filesystem::IOProxy`` that will handle the I/O, for
       example by writing to a memory buffer.
   * - ``oiio:dither``
     - int
     - If nonzero and outputting UINT8 values in the file, will add a small
       amount of random dither to combat the appearance of banding

**Custom I/O Overrides**

PNG output supports the "custom I/O" feature via the special
``"oiio:ioproxy"`` attributes (see Section :ref:`sec-imageoutput-ioproxy`).

**Limitations**

* PNG stupidly specifies that any alpha channel is "unassociated" (i.e.,
  that the color channels are not "premultiplied" by alpha). This is a
  disaster, since it results in bad loss of precision for alpha image
  compositing, and even makes it impossible to properly represent certain
  additive glows and other desirable pixel values. OpenImageIO automatically
  associates alpha (i.e., multiplies colors by alpha) upon input and
  deassociates alpha (divides colors by alpha) upon output in order to
  properly conform to the OIIO convention (and common sense) that all pixel
  values passed through the OIIO APIs should use associated alpha.

* PNG only supports UINT8 and UINT16 output; other requested formats will be
  automatically converted to one of these.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-pnm:

PNM / Netpbm
===============================================

The Netpbm project, a.k.a. PNM (portable "any" map) defines PBM, PGM,
and PPM (portable bitmap, portable graymap, portable pixmap) files.
Without loss of generality, we will refer to these all collectively as
"PNM."  These files have extensions :file:`.pbm`, :file:`.pgm`, and
:file:`.ppm` and customarily correspond to bi-level bitmaps, 1-channel
grayscale, and 3-channel RGB files, respectively, or :file:`.pnm` for
those who reject the nonsense about naming the files depending on the
number of channels and bitdepth.

PNM files are not much good for anything, but because of their
historical significance and extreme simplicity (that causes many
"amateur" programs to write images in these formats), OpenImageIO
supports them.  PNM files do not support floating point images, anything
other than 1 or 3 channels, no tiles, no multi-image, no MIPmapping.
It's not a smart choice unless you are sending your images back to the
1980's via a time machine.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - PNM header data or explanation
   * - ``oiio:BitsPerSample``
     - int
     - The true bits per sample of the file (1 for true PBM files, even
       though OIIO will report the ``format`` as UINT8).
   * - ``pnm:binary``
     - int
     - nonzero if the file itself used the PNM binary format, 0 if it used
       ASCII.  The PNM writer honors this attribute in the ImageSpec to
       determine whether to write an ASCII or binary file.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-psd:

PSD
===============================================

PSD is the file format used for storing Adobe PhotoShop images. OpenImageIO
provides limited read abilities for PSD, but not currently the ability to
write PSD files.

**Configuration settings for PSD input**

When opening an ImageInput with a *configuration* (see
Section :ref:`sec-inputwithconfig`), the following special configuration
options are supported:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``oiio:RawColor``
     - int
     - If nonzero, reading images with non-RGB color models (such as YCbCr
       or CMYK) will return unaltered pixel values (versus the default OIIO
       behavior of automatically converting to RGB).

Currently, the PSD format reader supports color modes RGB, CMYK,
multichannel, grayscale, indexed, and bitmap. It does NOT currenty support
Lab or duotone modes.



|

.. _sec-bundledplugins-ptex:

Ptex
===============================================

Ptex is a special per-face texture format developed by Walt Disney
Feature Animation.  The format and software to read/write it are open
source, and available from http://ptex.us/.  Ptex files commonly
use the file extension :file:`.ptex`.

OpenImageIO's support of Ptex is still incomplete.  We can read pixels from
Ptex files, but the TextureSystem doesn't properly filter across face
boundaries when using it as a texture.  OpenImageIO currently does not write
Ptex files at all.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - Ptex header data or explanation
   * - ``ptex:meshType``
     - string
     - the mesh type, either ``"triangle"`` or ``"quad"``.
   * - ``ptex:hasEdits``
     - int
     - nonzero if the Ptex file has edits.
   * - ``wrapmode``
     - string
     - the wrap mode as specified by the Ptex file.
   * - *other*
     -
     - Any other arbitrary metadata in the Ptex file will be stored directly
       as attributes in the ImageSpec.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-raw:

RAW digital camera files
===============================================

A variety of digital camera "raw" formats are supported via this
plugin that is based on the LibRaw library (http://www.libraw.org/).

**Configuration settings for RAW input**

.. _sec-bundledplugins-sgi:

SGI
===============================================

The SGI image format was a simple raster format used long ago on SGI
machines.  SGI files use the file extensions ``sgi``, ``rgb``, ``rgba``,
``bw``, `int`, and ``inta``.

The SGI format is sometimes used for legacy apps, but has little merit
otherwise: no support for tiles, no MIPmaps, no multi-subimage, only 8- and

.. _sec-bundledplugins-pic:

Softimage PIC
===============================================

Softimage PIC is an image file format used by the SoftImage 3D application,
and some other programs that needed to be compatible with it.  Softimage
files use the file extension :file:`.pic`.

The Softimage PIC format is sometimes used for legacy apps, but has little
merit otherwise, so currently OpenImageIO only reads Softimage files and is
unable to write them.

   * - ``ImageDescription``
     - string
     - Comment
   * - ``oiio:BitsPerSample``
     - int
     - the true bits per sample of the PIC file.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-targa:

Targa
===============================================

Targa (a.k.a. Truevision TGA) is an image file format with little merit
except that it is very simple and is used by many legacy applications. Targa
files use the file extension :file:`.tga`, or, much more rarely,
:file:`.tpic`. The official Targa format specification may be found at:
http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~martino/disciplinas/ea978/tgaffs.pdf


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ImageSpec Attribute
     - Type
     - TGA header data or explanation
   * - ``ImageDescription``

     - TGA time stamp
   * - ``targa:JobTime``
     - string
     - TGA "job time."
   * - ``compression``
     - string
     - values of ``none`` and ``rle`` are supported.  The writer will use
       RLE compression if any unknown compression methods are requested.
   * - ``targa:ImageID``
     - string
     - Image ID
   * - ``PixelAspectRatio``
     - float
     - pixel aspect ratio

     - the true bits per sample of the PIC file.
   * - ``oiio:ColorSpace``
     - string
     - Color space (see Section :ref:`sec-metadata-color`).
   * - ``oiio:Gamma``
     - float
     - the gamma correction value (if specified).


If the TGA file contains a thumbnail, its dimensions will be stored in the
attributes ``"thumbnail_width"``, ``"thumbnail_height"``, and
``"thumbnail_nchannels"``, and the thumbnail pixels themselves will be
stored in ``"thumbnail_image"`` (as an array of UINT8 values, whose length
is the total number of channel samples in the thumbnail).

**Limitations**

* The Targa reader reserves enough memory for the entire image. Therefore it
  is not a good choice for high-performance image use such as would be used
  for ImageCache or TextureSystem.
* Targa files only support 8- and 16-bit unsigned integers (no signed,
  floating point, or HDR capabilities); the OpenImageIO TGA writer will
  silently convert all output images to UINT8 (except if UINT16 is
  explicitly requested).
* Targa only supports grayscale, RGB, and RGBA; the OpenImageIO TGA writer
  will fail its call to ``open()`` if it is asked create a file with more
  than 4 color channels.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-term:

Term (Terminal)
===============================================

This *experimental* output-only "format" is actually a procedural output
that writes a low-res representation of the image to the console output. It
requires a terminal application that supports Unicode and 24 bit color
extensions.

The `term` ImageOutput supports the following special metadata tokens to
control aspects of the writing itself:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Output Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``term:method``
     - string
     - May be one of `iterm2`, `24bit` (default), `24bit-space`, `256color`,
       or `dither`.
   * - ``term:fit``
     - int
     - If 1 (the default), the image will be resized to fit on the console
       window.



The `iterm2` mode is the best quality and is the default mode when actually
running on a Mac and launching using iTerm2 as the terminal. This mode uses
iTerm2's nonstandard extension to directly output an pixel array to be
visible in the terminal.

The default in other circumstances is the `24bit` mode, which displays two
approximately square pixels vertically in each character cell, by outputting
the Unicode "upper half block" glyph (`\u2508`) with the foreground color
set to the top pixel's color and the background color set to the bottom
pixel's color.

If this doesn't look right, or your terminal doesn't support Unicode,
the `24bit-space` is an alternate mode that displays one elongated pixel
in each character cell, writing a space character with the correct color.

There's also a `256color` method that just uses the 6x6x6 color space in the
256 color palette -- which looks horrible -- and an experimental `dither`
which does a half-assed Floyd-Steinberg dithering, horizontally only, and
frankly is not an improvement unless you squint really hard. These may
change or be eliminted in the future.

In all cases, the image will automatically be resized to fit in the terminal
and keep approximately the correct aspect ratio, as well as converted to
sRGB so it looks kinda ok.

.. _sec-bundledplugins-tiff:

TIFF
===============================================

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a flexible file format created by Aldus,
now controlled by Adobe.  TIFF supports nearly everything anybody could want
in an image format (and has extactly the complexity you would expect from
such a requirement). TIFF files commonly use the file extensions
:file:`.tif` or, :file:`.tiff`. Additionally, OpenImageIO associates the
following extensions with TIFF files by default: :file:`.tx`, :file:`.env`,
:file:`.sm`, :file:`.vsm`.

The official TIFF format specification may be found here:
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html The most popular
library for reading TIFF directly is :file:`libtiff`, available here:
http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/  OpenImageIO uses :file:`libtiff` for
its TIFF reading/writing.

We like TIFF a lot, especially since its complexity can be nicely hidden
behind OIIO's simple APIs.  It supports a wide variety of data formats
(though unfortunately not ``half``), an arbitrary number of channels, tiles
and multiple subimages (which makes it our preferred texture format), and a
rich set of metadata.

OpenImageIO supports the vast majority of TIFF features, including: tiled
images (``tiled``) as well as scanline images; multiple subimages per file
(``multiimage``); MIPmapping (using multi-subimage; that means you can't use
multiimage and MIPmaps simultaneously); data formats 8- 16, and 32 bit
integer (both signed and unsigned), and 32- and 64-bit floating point;
palette images (will convert to RGB); "miniswhite" photometric mode (will
convert to "minisblack").

The TIFF plugin attempts to support all the standard Exif, IPTC, and XMP
metadata if present.

**Configuration settings for TIFF input**

When opening an ImageInput with a *configuration* (see
Section :ref:`sec-inputwithconfig`), the following special configuration
options are supported:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``oiio:UnassociatedAlpha``
     - int
     - If nonzero, will leave alpha unassociated (versus the default of
       premultiplying color channels by alpha if the alpha channel is
       unassociated).
   * - ``oiio:RawColor``
     - int
     - If nonzero, reading images with non-RGB color models (such as YCbCr)
       will return unaltered pixel values (versus the default OIIO behavior
       of automatically converting to RGB).

**Configuration settings for TIFF output**

When opening an ImageOutput, the following special metadata tokens control
aspects of the writing itself:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 10 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Output Configuration Attribute
     - Type
     - Meaning
   * - ``oiio:UnassociatedAlpha``
     - int
     - If nonzero, any alpha channel is understood to be unassociated, and
       the EXTRASAMPLES tag in the TIFF file will be set to reflect this).
   * - ``oiio:BitsPerSample``
     - int
     - Requests a rescaling to a specific bits per sample (such as writing
       12-bit TIFFs).
   * - ``tiff:write_exif``
     - int
     - If zero, will not write any Exif data to the TIFF file. (The default
       is 1.)
   * - ``tiff:half``
     - int
     - If nonzero, allow writing TIFF files with `half` (16 bit float)
       pixels. The default of 0 will automatically translate to float
       pixels, since most non-OIIO applications will not properly read half
       TIFF files despite their being legal.
   * - ``tiff:ColorSpace``
     - string
     - Requests that the file be saved with a non-RGB color spaces. Choices
       are ``RGB``, ``CMYK``. % , ``YCbCr``, ``CIELAB``, ``ICCLAB``,
       ``ITULAB``.
   * - ``tiff:zipquality``
     - int
     - A time-vs-quality knob for ``zip`` compression, ranging from 1-9
       (default is 6). Higher means compress to less space, but taking
       longer to do so. It is strictly a time vs space tradeoff, the quality
       is identical (lossless) no matter what the setting.
   * - ``tiff:RowsPerStrip``
     - int
     - Overrides TIFF scanline rows per strip with a specific request (if
       not supplied, OIIO will choose a reasonable default).


**TIFF compression modes**

The full list of possible TIFF compression mode values are as
follows ($ ^*$ indicates that OpenImageIO can write that format, and is not
part of the format name):

    ``none`` $ ^*$
    ``lzw`` $ ^*$
    ``zip`` $ ^*$
    ``ccitt_t4``
    ``ccitt_t6``
    ``ccittfax3``
    ``ccittfax4``
    ``ccittrle2``
    ``ccittrle`` $ ^*$
    ``dcs``
    ``isojbig``
    ``IT8BL``
    ``IT8CTPAD``
    ``IT8LW``
    ``IT8MP``
    ``jp2000``
    ``jpeg`` $ ^*$
    ``lzma``
    ``next``
    ``ojpeg``
    ``packbits`` $ ^*$

    ``pixarlog``
    ``sgilog24``
    ``sgilog``
    ``T43``
    ``T85``
    ``thunderscan``

**Limitations**

OpenImageIO's TIFF reader and writer have some limitations you should be
aware of:

* No separate per-channel data formats (not supported by :file:`libtiff`).
* Only multiples of 8 bits per pixel may be passed through OpenImageIO's
  APIs, e.g., 1-, 2-, and 4-bits per pixel will be passed by OIIO as 8 bit
  images; 12 bits per pixel will be passed as 16, etc.  But the
  ``oiio:BitsPerSample`` attribute in the ImageSpec will correctly report
  the original bit depth of the file. Similarly for output, you must pass 8
  or 16 bit output, but ``oiio:BitsPerSample`` gives a hint about how you
  want it to be when written to the file, and it will try to accommodate the
  request (for signed integers, TIFF output can accommodate 2, 4, 8, 10, 12,
  and 16 bits).
* JPEG compression is limited to 8-bit per channel, 3-channel files.

Zfile
===============================================

Zfile is a very simple format for writing a depth (*z*) image, originally
from Pixar's PhotoRealistic RenderMan but now supported by many other
renderers.  It's extremely minimal, holding only a width, height,
world-to-screen and camera-to-screen matrices, and uncompressed float pixels
of the z-buffer. Zfile files use the file extension :file:`.zfile`.
