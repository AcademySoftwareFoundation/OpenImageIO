/*
  Brief documentation about the RLA format:

  * The file consists of multiple subimages, merely contatenated together.
    Each subimage starts with a RLAHeader, and within the header is a
    NextOffset field that gives the absolute offset (relative to the start
    of the file) of the beginning of the next subimage, or 0 if there
    is no next subimage.

  * Immediately following the header is the scanline offset table, which
    is one uint32 for each scanline, giving the absolute offset for the
    beginning of that scanline record.  By convention, RLA scanline 0 is
    displayed at the bottom of the image (the opposite of OIIO convention).

  * Each scanline consists of up to three channel groups, concatenated
    together: color, then matte, then auxiliary.  Each group may have a
    different data type and bit depth.

  * A channel group consists of its channels (separate, non-interleaved)
    concatenated together.

  * A channel is stored in an RLE record, which consists of a uint16
    given the length of encoded data, then the encoded data run.

  * The encoded data run consists of a signed "count" byte.  If the
    count >= 0, the next byte is the pixel value, which is be repeated
    count+1 times as output.  If count < 0, then the next abs(count)
    bytes should be copied directly to as output.

  * For SHORT (16 bit), LONG (32 bit), or FLOAT pixel data types, 
    the most significant 8 bits of each pixel come first, then the
    next less significant 8 bits, and so on.  For example, for 16 bit
    data (HL), the sequence will be H0 H1 H2 ... L0 L1 L2 ...
    Therefore, the bytes will need to be re-interleaved to form 
    contiguous 16 or 32 bit values in the output buffer.

  * But float data is not RLE compressed, instead just dumped raw after
    the RLE length.  Well, at least according to old code at SPI.  We
    have no original RLA specification that stipulates this to be the
    case.

  * RLA files are "big endian" for all 16 and 32 bit data: header fields,
    offsets, and pixel data.
