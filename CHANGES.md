**Executive Summary / Highlights:**

- Updated minimum toolchain: C++17/gcc9.3, Python 3.7, CMake 3.18.2, and
  raised min versions of most library dependencies.
- New image format support: JPEG XL, R3D.
- oiiotool new commands: --cryptomatte-colors, --demosaic, --buildinfo,
  --ocionamedtransform, --popbottom, --stackreverse, --stackclear,
  --stackextract; improved --for behavior for reverse direction.
- Lots of long-deprecated API calls have been removed entirely.
  Please see [the detailed deprecation list](docs/Deprecations-3.0.md).
- New ImageBufAlgo: perpixel_op, demosaic, ocionamedtransform.
- ImageBuf now by default does not use ImageCache to mediate file images,
  unless you explicitly ask for it.
- ImageCache & TextureSystem now use shared_ptr for creation, not raw
  pointers. And they have been de-virtualized, for easier future expansion
  flexibility without breaking ABI for any small change.
- Improved and more consistent color space name nomenclature.
- Build system now is capable of auto-downloading and building several
  of the most important dependencies if they are missing at build time.
- Please note that the development branch in the GitHub repo is now named
  `main` instead of `master`.

Full details of all changes follow.

### New minimum dependencies and compatibility changes:
* *C++*: Move to C++17 standard minimum (from 14), which also implies a
  minimum gcc 9.3 (raised from 6.3), clang 5 (though we don't test or support

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è  New features and public API changes:

* *New image file format support:*
    - *JPEG XL*: Initial JPEG XL support for image input/output [#4055](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4055) (by Peter Kov√°≈ô) [#4252](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4252) (by Vlad (Kuzmin) Erium) (2.6.2.0) [#4310](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4310) (by Vlad (Kuzmin) Erium) (2.6.3.0) 
    - *R3D*: Add initial support to read R3D files. Note that this capability will only be enabled if OIIO is built with the R3D SDK installed and available to be found by the build system. [#4216](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4216) (by Peter Kov√°≈ô) (2.6.2.0)
* *oiiotool new features and major improvements*:
    - `--cryptomatte-colors` takes the name of a cryptomatte set of channels, and produces a color-coded matte in which each ID gets a distinct color in the image. This can be useful for visualizing the matte, among other things. [#4093](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4093) (2.6.0.2)
    - `--demosaic` takes 1-channel Bayer patterns and turn them into
      demosaiced 3-channel images [#4366](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4366) (by Anton Dukhovnikov) (2.6.3.0) [#4419](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4419) (by Anton Dukhovnikov) (2.6.6.0)
    - `--buildinfo` command prints build information, including
      version, compiler, and all library dependencies. [#4124](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4124) (2.6.0.3) [#4150](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4150) (2.6.0.3)
    - `--ocionamedtransform`: Implement support for OCIO NamedTransforms [#4393](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4393) (by zachlewis) (2.6.3.0)
    - Several new stack manipulation commands: `--popbottom` discards the bottom
      element of the stack, `--stackreverse` reverses the order of the whole stack,
     `--stackclear` fully empties the stack, `--stackextract <index>` moves the
     indexed item from the stack (index 0 means the top) to the top. [#4348](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4348) (2.6.3.0)
    - `--for` improvements: correct reverse iteration behavior if the step value
      is negative, or if there is no step value but the start value is greater than
      the end value. (https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4348) (2.6.3.0)
    - Expression evaluation improvements: `BOTTOM` refers to the image on the bottom of the stack, `IMG[expression]` is now supported (previously only numeric literals were accepted as the index), check that label/variable names [#4334](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4334) (2.6.3.0)
    - oiiotool now by default does immediate reads without relying on an
      ImageCache, unless the `--cache` option is used, which now both enables
      the use of an underlying IC as well as setting its size. This tends to
      improve performance.
      [#3986](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/3986) (2.6.0.1, 2.5.3.1)
    - Change command line embedding for oiiotool & maketx output, by default hiding the command line for security reasons. It can be re-enabled with `--history`. [#4237](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4237) (2.6.2.0)
* *Command line utilities*:
    - *idiff*: Allow users to specify a directory as the 2nd argument [#4015](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4015) (by David Aguilar) (2.6.0.1)
    - *iv*: Implement Directory Argument Loading for iv [#4010](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4010) (by Chaitanya Sharma) (2.6.0.1)
    - *iv*: Split off the current image in iv into a separate window [#4017](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4017) (by Anton Dukhovnikov) (2.6.0.1)
    - *iv*: OCIO color managed display [#4031](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4031) (by Anton Dukhovnikov) (2.6.0.2)
    - *iv*: Iv shows constant brown and GL error messages on start-up. [#4451](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4451) (by David Adler) (2.6.6.0)
    - *iv*: Initialize variables before we use them. [#4457](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4457) (by Bram Stolk) (2.6.6.0)
    - *iv*: Add iv data and display windows overlay feature [#4443](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4443) (by Andy Chan) (2.6.6.0)
* New global attribute queries via OIIO::getattribute():
    - "build:platform", "build:compiler", "build:dependencies" [#4124](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4124) (2.6.0.3)
    - "build:simd" is the new preferred synonym for the old name "oiio:simd" [#4124](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4124) (2.6.0.3)
* *ImageBuf/ImageBufAlgo*:
    - ImageBuf now has span-based constructors for the variety where it
      "wraps" a user buffer. This is preferred over the constructor that
      takes a raw pointer (which is considered deprecated). [#4401](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4401) (2.6.6.0)
    - New span-based versions of get_pixels, set_pixels, setpixel, getpixel,
      interppixel, interppixel_NDC, interppixel_bicubic,
      interppixel_bicubic_NDC. These are preferred over the old versions that
      took raw pointers. [#4426](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4426) (2.6.6.0)
    - Start using optional keyword/value params for some ImageBufAlgo functions. [#4149](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4149)
    - Only back ImageBuf with ImageCache when passed an IC
      [#3986](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/3986) (2.6.0.1, 2.5.3.1)
    - Make ImageBuf::Iterator lazy in its making the image writable [#4033](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4033) (2.6.0.2)
    - `IBA::perpixel_op()` is a new way to write IBA-like functions very
      simply, only supplying the very inner part of the loop that operates on
      one pixel. [#4299](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4299) (2.6.3.0) [#4409](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4409) (2.6.6.0)
    - `IBA::demosaic()` takes 1-channel Bayer patterns and turn them into
       demosaiced 3-channel images [#4366](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4366) (by Anton Dukhovnikov) (2.6.3.0)
    - `IBA::ocionamedtransform()`: Implement support for OCIO NamedTransforms [#4393](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4393) (by zachlewis) (2.6.3.0)
* *ImageInput / ImageOutput*:
    - Add virtual `heapsize()` and `footprint()` to ImageInput and ImageOutput [#4323](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4323) (by Basile Fraboni) (2.6.3.0)
* *ImageCache/TextureSystem*:
    - Use `shared_ptr` for ImageCache and TextureSystem creation [#4377](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4377) (2.6.3.0)
    - Overload decode_wrapmode to support ustringhash [#4207](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4207) (by Chris Hellmuth) (2.6.1.0)
    - Add pvt::heapsize() and pvt::footprint() methods and image cache memory tracking [#4322](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4322) (by Basile Fraboni) (2.6.3.0)
    - De-virtualize ImageCache and TextureSystem [#4384](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4384) (2.6.3.0)
    - IC/TS have new `get_imagespec()`, `imagespec()`, and `get_cache_dimensions()`
      methods. [#4442](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4442) (by Basile Fraboni) (2.6.6.0)
    - *python*: Implement ImageCache.get_imagespec() [#3982](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/3982) (2.6.0.0, 2.5.3.1-beta2)
    - `TextureOpt` has been refactored a bit: some fields have been reordered;
      it's actually called TextureOpt_v2 (TextureOpt is an alias) to allow
      better compatibility-preserving improvements in the future, and
      similarly, TextureOptBatched is an alias for TextureOptBatch_v1. The
      type names of some enums have been changed, but aliases should preserve
      compatibility in the vast majority of cases. [#4485](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4485) [#4490](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4490)
      (3.0.0.0)
* *API Deprecations*: (please see [the detailed deprecation list](docs/Deprecations-3.0.md))
    - Various other minor deprecations of things that had been marked as
      deprecated for a while in fmath.h [#4309](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4309) (2.6.2.0), typedesc.h [#4311](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4311) (2.6.2.0), simd.h [#4308](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4308) (2.6.2.0), assorted [#4234](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4234) (2.6.2.0), texture.h [#4339](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4339) (2.6.3.0), imageio.h [#4312](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4312) (2.6.3.0), benchmark.h, bit.h, color.h, errorhandler.h [#4335](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4335), parmalist.h, parallel.h, strutil.h, sysutil.h, thread.h, tiffutils.h, ustring.h, type_traits.h [#4338](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4338) (2.6.3.0), imagebuf.h [#4341](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4341) (2.6.3.0), imagebufalgo.h [#4344](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4344) (2.6.3.0),
      dassert.h imagebufalgo.h imagecache.h imageio.h simd.h strutil.h ustring.h [#4480](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4480) [#4488](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4488) (3.0.0.0)
    - The deprecated headers array_view.h and missing_math.h have been removed. [#4335](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4335) [#4338](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4338) (2.6.3.0)
    - Make span::size() return size_t, not a signed type [#4332](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4332) (2.6.3.0)
* *Build system dependency self-builders*: <br>
  The cmake-based build system has
  been enhanced to give a report of what dependencies it found, what was
  missing, what was found but was a version too old for our requirement.
  If the `OpenImageIO_BUILD_MISSING_DEPS` cmake variable is set to "all"
  (or a list of specific packages), the build system will attempt to
  build certain missing dependencies locally. Currently, this works for
  fmt, freetype, Imath, jpeg-turbo, libtiff, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR, pybind11, Robinmap, WebP, Zlib.
  Additional dependencies will learn to self-build over time.
  [#4242](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4242)
  [#4294](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4294) by Larry Gritz,
  [#4392](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4392) by zachlewis (2.6.3.0)
  [#4420](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4420) (by zachlewis) (2.6.6.0)
  [#4422](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4422) (by zachlewis) (3.0.0.1)
  [#4493](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4493) (by kaarrot) (3.0.0.1)
* *Environment variables*
    - The environment variable `OIIO_LIBRARY_PATH` that contains the search
      paths for finding image file format plugins has been changed to be
      called `OPENIMAGEIO_PLUGIN_PATH`. This is more consistent: all the
      "public API" documented environment variables that are meant for
      users/sites to adjust are named starting with `OPENIMAGEIO_`, whereas
      the prefix `OIIO_` is only used for environment variables that are
      "unofficial" (undocumented, temporary, or meant only for developers to
      use for debugging). [#4330](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4330) (2.6.3.0)
    - Rename env variable `OIIOTOOL_METADATA_HISTORY` to
      `OPENIMAGEIO_METADATA_HISTORY` [#4368](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4368) (2.6.3.0)

### üöÄ  Performance improvements:
  - *oiiotool*: `--mosaic` improvements to type conversion avoid unnecessary
  copies and format conversions. [#3979](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/3979) (2.6.0.0, 2.5.3.1-beta2)
  - *oiiotool*: Use pointer, not static, for internal color config, slightly reducing oiiotool startup overhead when color configs are not needed. [#4433](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4433) (2.6.6.0)
  - *simd*: Faster vint4 load/store with unsigned char conversion [#4071](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4071) (by Aras Pranckeviƒçius) (2.6.0.2)
  - *perf/IBA*: Improve perf of IBA::channels in-place operation [#4088](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4088) (2.6.0.2)
  - *perf*: Overhaul of ColorConfig internals to solve perf issues [#3995](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/3995) (2.6.0.1)
  - *perf/TS*: Reduce TextureSystem memory by slimming down internal LevelInfo size [#4337](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4337) (by Curtis Black) (2.6.3.0)
  - *TS*: Have maketx/IBA::make_texture only write full metadata to the first mip level. We presume that other than resolution and encoding-related information, other metadata should not be expected to differ between MIP levels of the same image. This saves file size and memory in the IC/TS. [#4320](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4320) (2.6.3.0)
  - *IC/TS*: Store full metadata only at subimage 0, miplevel 0 for ptex files. [#4376](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4376) (2.6.3.0)
  - *perf*: Additional timing logging for performance investigations [#4506](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4506) (3.0.0.1)
  - *ImageBuf*: ImageBuf file read performance -- double reads, extra copies [#4507](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4507) (3.0.0.1)

### üêõ  Fixes and feature enhancements:
  - *errors*: Print unretrieved global error messages upon application exit.
    This should help beginning developers see important error messages they
    have failed to retrieve. [#4005](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4005) (2.6.0.1)
  - *font rendering*: Improvements to text rendering by
    `ImageBufAlgo::render_text()` and `oiiotool --text`:
      - Look up font in text render based on family and style name, in
        addition to font filename. [#4509](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4509) (by peterhorvath111) (3.0.0.1)
      - Fix incorrect vertical alignment in render_text [#4500](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4500) (by peterhorvath111) (3.0.0.1)
      - Windows newline shows invalid character in text render [#4501](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4501) (by peterhorvath111) (3.0.0.1)
      - Improve internals of font search enumeration [#4508](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/pull/4508) (by peterhorvath111) (3.0.0.1)
