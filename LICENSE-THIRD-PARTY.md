See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for the main open source license of original
code written for the OpenImageIO project.

The remainder of this file reproduces the open source licensing details
of other projects that have been imported, incorporated into, or derived
into parts of OIIO.

* Gelato, Copyright (c) 2004 by NVIDIA Corp.

  The initial (version 0.1) code found in imageio.h, fmath.h, filter.h,
  argparse, and the JPEG reader/writer had elements derived from
  BSD-licensed example code and headers from NVIDIA's Gelato Renderer. It's
  not clear that any of that original code still survives in the modern
  OIIO, but since some elements are derived from that, we still acknowledge
  the original copyright here.

* Open Shading Language. Copyright Sony Pictures Imageworks Inc.

  A few parts here and there, notably parts of fmath.h and many of the CMake
  files, contain code that was originally developed for Open Shading
  Language but subsequently moved to OIIO.

* DPX reader/writer (c) Copyright 2009 Patrick A. Palmer.

* KissFFT (c) Copyright 2003-2010 Mark Borgerding
