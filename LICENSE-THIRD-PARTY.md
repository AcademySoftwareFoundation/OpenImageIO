See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for the main open source license of original
code written for the OpenImageIO project.

The remainder of this file reproduces the open source licensing details
of other projects that have been imported, incorporated into, or derived
into parts of OIIO.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial (version 0.1) code found in imageio.h, fmath.h, filter.h,
argparse, and the JPEG reader/writer had elements derived from BSD-licensed
example code from NVIDIA's Gelato Renderer.

It's not clear that any of that original code still survives in the modern
OIIO, but since some elements are derive works from that, we still reproduce
the original copyright here:

Standard 3-clause BSD license: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few parts here and there, notably parts of fmath.h and many of the
CMake files, contain code that was originally developed for Open Shading
Language but subsequently moved to OIIO. Those portions are

Some math functions in fmath.h are derived from the
[Sleef library](https://sleef.org), which uses the Boost license.
