Release 0.7 (Nov 26 2009)
--------------------------

Major new features:

* New format plugin: JPEG-2000 (r1050)
* New format plugin: FITS (r1287 et al)
* TextureSystem: two new entries to TextureOptions which allow the texture
  system to return the derivatives in s and t of the texture. (r1308)

API changes:

* Added imagespec() method to ImageCache and TextureSystem that returns a
  reference to the internal ImageSpec of the image.  This is much more
  efficient than get_imagespec, but beware, the pointer is only valid 
  until somebody calls invalidate() on the file.  (r1266)
* TextureOptions: eliminated the 'alpha' field.  Added the dresultds and
  dresultdt fields.
* Extend TypeDesc to include INT64 and UINT64. (r1145)

Fixes, minor enhancements, and performance improvements:

* Make EMBEDPLUGINS=1 the default. (0.7.1)
* Improvements to the Targa plugin, bringing it into compliance with
  TGA 2.0 (r1163, r1297)
* Fixed PNG-related crashes on 64 bit machines. (r1336)
* iv improvements: support for multichannel images and different color
  modes (r1129), support auto use mipmap level based on zooming (r1093),
  correct pixelview for rotated images (r1092), fix off-by-one error
  with some zoom levels (r1089).
* maketx: fixed problem where it was sometimes not setting the output
  data format to match the input data format correctly (r1290), fixed
  problems with writing EXR files with --nomipmap (r1286), fixed cases
  where data window was not the same as display window (i.e. crop or
  overscan).
* ImageCache/TextureSystem: various threading and performance improvements.
  (r1188, r1211, r1288, r1299)
* TS: fixed incorrect "texturetype" results of get_texture_info. (r1314)
* IC/TS: fixed crasher bugs when doing get_pixels of images that had
  non-zero data window origin. (r1313)
* IC/TS: better error messages and recovery from spooky open and read_tile
  failures. (r1321)
* When IC/TS reads and entire (untiled) image, the file is closed afterwards.
  This is especially helpful on Windows where open files are locked to
  writing by other processes. (r1298)
* HUGE speedup of ImageCache::get_image_info (and TS::get_texture_info)
  b replacing strcmp's with ustring == (r1281).
* IC: fixed various subtle logic errors with broken files and
  invalidate/invalidate_all. (r1252, r1279)
* IC/TS: fixed memory leak of per-thread imagecache data and subtle race 
  conditions. (r1057, r1216, r1222, r1238)
* TS: fixed problem where missing or broken textures weren't using the 
  right fill color. (r1268)
* IC: Clamp cache size to a reasonable lower limit (r1256)
* TS: improvements to filter estimation (1134) and bicubic interpolation 
  numerical stability and speed (r1166, r1179, r1333).
* IC: when autotile=0 but automip=1, fixed bug that was wasting HUGE
  amounts of memory by using the wrong resolution for mip levels! (r1147)
* IC: fix an edge case where tiles could leak. (r1044)
* Fixed some hairy static initialization problems with ustring (r1280)
* Use a spin lock rather than block in ustring constructor gives HUGE 
  speedup especially on Windows. (r1167)
* TS: Make everything work for textures whose image origin is not (0,0)
  or whose pixel data window doesn't match the image window (i.e. crop
  windows or overscan).  (r1332)
* IC/TS: Correctly invalidate files afected by recently changed "automip"
  setting. (r1337)
* IC/TS: fix crash that could occur with non-existant textures in combination
  with invalidate_all(). (r1338)
* Make create() error messages more helpful. (0.7.1)

For developers:

* Build more easily when older OpenEXR versions are found. (r1082)
* HTML Doxygen documentation on the public APIs. (r1311, r1312, et al)
* Sysutil::this_program_path finds the full path of the running program.
  (r1304)
* Better compiler-side error checking of printf-like functions (r1302)
* A new site/... area where important users with local build customization 
  needs can check in (reasonably sized) custom makefiles or other helpful
  things. (r1284)
* New ErrorHandler class, currently unused by OIIO itself, but very handy.
  (r1265)
* Fixed lots of compiler warnings.
* Upgraded to a more recent TBB, which fixed some atomic problems. (r1211)
* ustring: make string comparison safe for empty strings. (r1330)
* Include file fixes for gcc 4.4. (r1331)
* Regularize all #include references to Imath and Openexr to 
  <OpenEXR/blah>. (r1335)



Release 0.6 (Jul 20, 2009)
--------------------------

Major new features:

* Everything has been ported to Windows.
* iv: handle older cards or versions of OpenGL, including lack of GLSL,
  non-pow2 textures, etc.  Generally should now be usable (if slightly
  degraded functionality) for most OpenGL 1.x implementations. (r764)
* ImageBuf that only reads images is now automatically backed by
  ImageCache.  In the process, add Iterator and ConstIterator as "safe"
  and efficient ways to visit all the pixels within a region of the
  image, and eliminate the unsafe pixeladdr() method.  Also added
  ImageCache::attribute("forcefloat") to conveniently force all
  ImageCache internal storage to be float.  (r770,771,772,775,803,805)
* iv can now support "big" images, in particular larger than the OpenGL
  texture limit (4k), and also very big images via the use of ImageCache 
  (r912).
* Truevision Targa (TGA) support. (r776,792)

API changes:
* In a variety of places that specified pixel rectangles (including
  ImageCache::get_pixels and TextureSystem::get_texels), specify regions
  as (xbegin,xend,ybegin,yend) rather than (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax).
  Note that 'end' is, like STL, one past the last pixel. (r771)
* All classes now query error messages using geterror().  Previously some
  used geterror() and others used error_message(). The old error_message
  is deprecated and will be removed in a future release (r957).

Fixes and minor enhancements:

* OpenEXR plugin improvements: don't set "textureformat" attribute
  unless it really is a mip-mapped texture.  Preserve the mipmap
  rounding mode when copying OpenEXR files, by using the
  "openexr:roundingmode" metadata (r801). Properly mark the alpha
  and z channels in the ImageSpec (r885).
* TIFF plugin improvements: handle 2 bpp images, properly name channels
  when reading palette images (r802), no longer uses the
  PREDICTOR_FLOATINGPOINT, since older versions of libtiff can't read
  those files (r752). Properly set the Exif sRGB marker (r888).
* BMP plugin improvements: allows top-down scanlines as well as bottom-up,
  correctly reads 4-, 8- and 24-bit images that have scanlines padded to 
  4-byte boundaries.
* ImageBuf algorithms: crop, add (r892).
* EXPERIMENTAL: 'iprocess' utility that lets you do some simple image
  processing operations (r892).
* ImageCache additional statistics: file open time (r743), alert if
  mip-mapped images are accessed at only their highest-res level (r743).
  Properly emulates random access reads of LZW-compressed files (r920).
* iv: fix problems displaying images whose width was not a multiple of 4
  bytes (r767), when loading small images, the window starts out a
  usable minimum size, iv always raises the window upon first opening,
  fix pixelview of alpha in RGB images (r939).
* iv: Fix off-by-one error that drew the last scanline incorrectly
  sometimes (r1089).  Give feedback when doing a slow repaint (r1089).
* iv improvements: fix skew-like problems with Intel cards, fix non-GLSL
  texture mapping, limit texture size to 4096^2 to keep GL memory use
  reasonable make "Reload" work again after breaking a few patches ago
  (r1090).
* maketx: in the case where the input texture was already float and needed
  no pow2 rounding, we didn't get the tiling or other metadata right (r824)
* ImageCache and TextureSystem do a better job of reporting low-level
  ImageInput errors up the chain (r945).
* ImageCache: new option "accept_untiled", when set to zero, will reject
  untiled images (r979).
* 'maketx --hash' embeds a SHA-1 fingerprint of the source image's
  pixels in the texture file header's "ImageDescription" field.
  ImageCache (and TextureSystem) will recognize these and eliminate
  redundant I/O when it finds multiple files with identical pixels.
  (r741,742)
* iinfo: eliminate --md5 in favor of --hash (computing SHA-1). (r749)
* Fix ImageCache and TextureSystem to have thread-specific error 
  reporting. (r1045)
* TextureSystem: fixed subtle bug in destruction order that could
  double-free per-thread data. (r1057)
* ImageCache: now get_image_info("format") returns teh native data format
  of the file. (r1058)
* maketx: properly handle input files where the data window is not the
  same as the display window or if the image offset was nonzero.  The
  correct semantics are that the DISPLAY window is what maps to [0,1] in
  texture space. (r1059)

For developers:

* Lots of fixes for Windows compilation (r754, r860)
* A build option for whether or not to use TBB for atomics.  (r780)
* New test suite entries: tiff-suite, tiff-depths (r787,788), openexr-suite,
  openexr-multires, openexr-chroma (r789,790,791).
* New unit tests for ImageBuf::zero, ImageBuf::fill, ImageBufAlgo::crop (r891).
* Reorganization of unit tests.
* Improvements to ArgParse internals and interface.
* All the macros that prevent double-inclusion of header files have had
  their names changed from FILENAME_H to OPENIMAGEIO_FILENAME_H so that
  they don't conflict with other package (r967).
* Reorganized test suite hierarchy.
* Optionally allow the entire library to be enclosed in a versioned
  namespace (via 'make NAMESPACE=foo') .
* Upgraded to a more recent version of TBB that seems to have fixed some
  bugs with atomic counters. (r1027)
