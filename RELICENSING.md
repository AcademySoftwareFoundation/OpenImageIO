Here are the instructions we have been given by the Linux Foundation for how
to document the contents of each file:

a. Files that consist of only contributions made entirely by companies that
   have submitted PRs as described above can have, once those PRs are merged,
   the BSD-3-Clause license information replaced with Apache-2.0 license
   information.

b. Files that contain contributions made after the change to the Apache-2.0
   license as the license for the project should include only the Apache-2.0
   license information.

c. Files that contain contributions made both before the Apache-2.0 license
   change and after the Apache-2.0 license change should include both
   BSD-3-Clause and Apache-2.0 license information. The SPDX identifier for
   these files is “BSD-3-Clause and Apache-2.0”.

d. Files that contain only contributions made prior to the Apache-2.0 license
   change should continue to include BSD-3-Clause license information (e.g.,
   no changes to BSD-3-Clause information included in those files).
