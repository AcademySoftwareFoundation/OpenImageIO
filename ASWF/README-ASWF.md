OpenImageIO has been accepted to be an ASWF-administered project, by vote of
the ASWF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) on May 3, 2023.

At this time, the ASWF subdirectory contains *proposed* (and sometimes TBD/WIP
placeholders) project organization and policy documents that will be formally
adopted as the OpenImageIO project is formally turned over to ASWF and moved
to the AcademySoftwareFoundation GitHub account. Please file issues or PRs
or review comments against these documents to make any suggested changes while
we are revising the drafts.

Summary of the current state of documents:

| File | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| CLA-corporate.md | Proposed / assumed final | This is the standard ASWF corporate CLA used for the other projects. |
| CLA-individual.md | Proposed / assumed final | This is the standard ASWF individual CLA used for the other projects. |
| Technical-Charter.md | placeholder | Proposed draft is not yet ready. |
| project_intake.md | Draft / placeholder? | Copy of OSL project intake checklist to get us started. Will be updated with the real OpenImageIO project intake checklist when it is provided to us. We expect it to be substantially similar.
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | Assumed final | Links to the standard LF CoC. |
| GOVERNANCE.md | Proposed | Copied and adapted from OSL. This is for us to decide and finalize. Please suggest any requested changes, **especially to the list of TSC members**. |
