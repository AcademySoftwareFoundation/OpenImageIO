OpenImageIO has been accepted to be an ASWF-administered project, by vote of
the ASWF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) on May 3, 2023.

At this time, the ASWF subdirectory contains *proposed* (and sometimes TBD/WIP
placeholders) project organization and policy documents that will be formally
adopted as the OpenImageIO project is formally turned over to ASWF and moved
to the AcademySoftwareFoundation GitHub account. Please file issues or PRs
or review comments against these documents to make any suggested changes while
we are revising the drafts.

Summary of the current state of documents:
